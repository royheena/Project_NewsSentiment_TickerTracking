0,0.9109,0.064,0.885,0.051,"Many of us are preparing for the new year and the changes we hope it'll bring. Many companies are also in look-forward mode, taking a little postholiday breather before vaulting into the coming decade.

Most, but not all. There have been several interesting developments with top stocks on the market. Two notable stocks saw their prices drop a bit with their latest pieces of news; here's who, what, and why.

Tesla

Monday saw two very different news items from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) -- or at least its management. After digesting them, investors traded the stock down by nearly 4% on Monday.

The vehicle maker delivered the first of its cars to be produced in China, with 15 workers at its factory near Shanghai receiving Model 3s made in the facility. The launch of Chinese production is certainly encouraging given the size of that market and its appetite for nonessential U.S. goods (I'm looking at you, Starbucks).

Yet this positive development might have been overshadowed by an update about one of CEO Elon Musk's pet projects. On Friday, in a response to a tweet about The Boring Company's commuter tunnel being built under the Las Vegas Convention Center, Musk tweeted back that it will be ""[h]opefully fully operational in 2020.""

Since Musk is the overwhelming majority owner of The Boring Company (get it?), the presumption is that he'll be busy managing aspects of the tunnel if it indeed opens next year. That will logically reduce the bandwidth he has to run Tesla, which, for all its renown, is still an upstart automaker burdened by huge costs and a limited customer base.

I understand the concern, but I don't think anything regarding Boring would change my view on Tesla stock. Though I think Musk has his flaws, and I'm not necessarily eager to invest in one of his ventures, the man does have ambition, imagination, and flair. He also seems capable of handling more than a few fast-moving projects at a time -- witness the recent happenings with SpaceX, for example.

In other words, if you believe in Musk -- he's a hands-on manager, and Tesla is very much a company in his image -- maybe you should buy Tesla stock at the current discount. If not, perhaps it's best to leave it alone.

CenturyLink

At least Elon Musk still has a job at his high-profile company. Soon, we won't be able to say the same for two members of CenturyLink 's (NYSE:CTL) board of directors. Following the announcement Monday of the pair's departure, plus several changes to the board's composition, the big telecom's stock slumped by a little more than 2%.

The company said that Glen Post, formerly its longtime CEO, will not stand for reelection at the upcoming annual general meeting (AGM) of shareholders. Additionally, board chairman Harvey Perry will retire, effective next May. Finally, the company said that Hal Jones, a former CFO of the company who once ran the newspaper The Washington Post, has been appointed as an independent director, effective Jan. 1.

Besides that, CenturyLink said that it aims to whittle the current 14-member board down to 11 directors at the AGM, 10 of whom should be independent (i.e., not simultaneously employed at the company). Directors should have tenures lasting no longer than one decade, while committee and board chairs should rotate once every five years or so.

It's a nervy time to be a CenturyLink shareholder. The telecom industry is charging into 5G, staking its future on ever-faster and better mobile connections. CenturyLink is a throwback in its way, holding fast to a big clutch of legacy wireline assets.

Still, though, the company has plenty of fast piping, specifically with its extensive fiber-optic infrastructure. Because the company is an internet service provider, I think this can keep it competitive in its admittedly unfashionable niche. Meanwhile, CenturyLink still throws off plenty of cash and pays a relatively high dividend despite having cut said payout not long ago.

I like what CenturyLink is doing to keep itself relevant, and I like this stock. I'd be contrarian here and buy on this little slump."
1,0.9961,0.129,0.858,0.014,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) will start delivering Model 3 vehicles built at its Gigafactory3 in Shanghai from today, per Reuters.

Notably, Gigafactory3 is China’s first completely foreign-owned car plant. Tesla started construction of the plant in January and began production in October. The company intends to produce 250,000 vehicles a year after Model Y production is added in the initial phase.

Today the plant will start delivering to customers just 357 days after construction of the factory started, thereby establishing a new record for global automakers in China.

The first 15 customers, who are slated to get their Model 3 cars, are employees of Tesla. Notably, the company wants to start delivering the cars, priced at $50,000 before subsidies, to the public before the start of the China New Year on January 25. The deliveries are not likely to affect Tesla’s financials for the fourth quarter.

The Gigafactory3 in Shanghai has been built as part of Tesla’s plan to boost presence in the world’s largest auto market, China, and reduce the impacts of the U.S.-China trade war.

Tesla treats China differently than anywhere else, with offerings such as showroom parties and racing events. Notably, it is also building service centers and charging stations throughout China to ensure reliable after-sales service to customers.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently stated it added China-made Model 3 of Tesla to a list of new energy vehicles that are excluded from purchase tax.

Shares of Tesla have outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year. Its shares have appreciated 29.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 24.3%.

The company is making efforts to improve vehicle deliveries, sequentially and annually, with some expected fluctuations due to seasonality. It is confident that it will exceed 360,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019. The company expects positive free cash flow as well as net income in the upcoming period, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp-up of newer products.

Advance Trade in U.S. Goods for the month of November has hit the tape ahead of Monday’s regular market open, posting an improvement both sequentially and year over year: a deficit of $63.2 billion is a notable improvement from the downwardly revised -$66.8 billion in October. Our trade deficit hit an all-time low in December of 2018 at -$79.8 billion; not only are we well off that nadir, but -$63.2 billion is the lowest monthly deficit of the last 12 months.

remains near the peak of its all-time record trading highs in the final days of 2019, and the company is celebrating today with the rollout of the first Model 3 cars built at its Shanghai Gigafactory (Gigafactory 3). Demand for the Model 3 has blasted off in this year’s calendar 4th quarter, following a boffo Q3 earnings report.
In Tesla’s last reported quarter, the company obliterated bottom-line estimates — the Zacks consensus has been for a loss of 15 cents — by posting earnings of $1.86 per share, for a positive surprise of 1340%. Tesla had missed its prior three quarterly estimates and still has a trailing 4-quarter average of +271%. Since then, TSLA shares are up 77%, and now in-line for full-year 2019 with the S&P 500, up 29%.
Last Thursday, Tesla filed with the SEC a securing of the equivalent of $1.3 billion U.S. (9 billion yuan) from local Chinese lenders to keep the Tesla line of electric autos going strong in mainland China. Though the country’s economy has been hurt by the ongoing trade war with the U.S., demand remains high for Tesla cars. The sticker price for a new Model 3 is 355,800 yuan ($50K U.S.), so high-net-worth individuals in China is the target market. And if the trade war is resolved in 2020, the sky is the theoretical limit for Tesla stock.

3,0.988,0.09,0.897,0.013,"Sometime this week -- probably on Thursday or Friday -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report its deliveries for its fourth quarter. If things go as planned. The company will set another quarterly record, fueled by increasing Model 3 production and deliveries.

So far, 2019 has proved to be a year of impressive execution for the electric-car maker, with deliveries rising throughout the year to a point that the company's full-year guidance range is within reach. Furthermore, the company broke ground on its factory in China and began producing cars in the same factory in just an 11-month timeframe.

As the year closes out, investors will be looking to Tesla's fourth-quarter delivery numbers for one last confirmation that the electric-car maker continued to execute well in the final quarter of 2019. Can Tesla hit its target of about 104,500 vehicle deliveries during the quarter?

What to expect from fourth-quarter deliveries

While Tesla didn't provide specific guidance for its fourth-quarter deliveries, management did say in its third-quarter update that it was on track to exceed the low end of its full-year outlook for deliveries. ""We are confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year,"" Tesla said.

To exceed this figure in Q4, Tesla would need to deliver at least 104,440 vehicles during the period, translating to 7% and 15% sequential and year-over-year growth, respectively.

Growth during the quarter will be driven by Model 3. Quarterly Model 3 production has been steadily rising, with production and deliveries of the vehicle hitting a record high in Q3 -- and management indicated this trend will continue in Q4.

But Model S and X deliveries could rise sequentially as well. Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn noted in the company's third-quarter earnings call that delivery numbers of the two vehicles during the period ""understated the interest in the product for that quarter."" The Model 3's production ramp has consumed much of the company's attention in 2019, Kirkhorn noted. Now that Model 3's production has stabilized at a high volume, Tesla is ""increasing production on our S and X lines for [Q4] in response to increasing demand,"" the CFO explained.

A year of rapid growth

If Tesla does exceed 360,000 deliveries in 2019, it will mark an impressive year of growth for Tesla. This would put total deliveries during the year up 47% year over year -- a notable achievement considering total deliveries soared 138% in 2018.

More importantly, by hitting this target, it would help investors take Tesla's annual targets more seriously. After taking longer than expected to ramp up its Model 3 deliveries following the vehicle's launch in the second half of 2017, the company's ambitious targets started to look more like lofty aspirations instead of achievable milestones. But if Tesla can exceed 360,000 deliveries in 2019, the company would reaffirm its ability to follow through on forecasts.

Tesla typically reports its quarterly deliveries within three days of a quarter's end. Investors, therefore, should expect an update on Tesla's fourth-quarter vehicle production and deliveries sometime between Jan. 1 and Jan. 3."
4,0.9936,0.105,0.838,0.057,"After a decade of virtually no returns -- thanks in large part to the bursting tech bubble in 2000-2001 and the Great Recession of 2008-2009 -- technology stocks roared higher in the 2010s. As measured by the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT:VGT), the sector gave investors a total return (share price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) of 398% over the last 10 years, including a 55% rally in 2019 alone.

Of course, that's the index overall. The best-of-the-best tech stocks did even better, some even returning over 1,000% over the last 10 years. With a new year and a new decade here, there's no need to worry that the boat has been missed. 2020 is a great time to add tech stocks to your portfolio -- especially if you plan on holding them for the next 10 years or more.

Technology is still leading the economy forward

One of the big technology investing themes of the 2010s was cloud computing -- digital services delivered from a remote data center to an end user via the internet and led by the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet 's (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) Google. While the cloud is well developed now in the U.S. and other developed markets, the rest of the world is still playing catch-up. Thus, the cloud investing thesis is still a solid one, expected to be a double-digit growth industry for the foreseeable future.

As growth in the cloud slows down here in the states, though, it's beginning to fuel new technological innovation. According to researcher Gartner (NYSE:IT), new tech trends like edge computing, automation and artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and autonomous machines and robotics will take over as the primary drivers of IT spending. In fact, after global IT budgets ended 2019 roughly flat with 2018 (blame the trade war between the U.S. and China), Gartner expects a 3.7% rebound in 2020 global IT spending.

I know 3.7% doesn't sound like much, but bear in mind that global GDP is expected to be in the 3.5% ballpark in the next year. Plus, the annual amount spent on technology was pegged at $3.7 trillion in 2019. Thus, even a low single-digit growth figure means lots of new dollars to go around, with the aforementioned emerging growth trends capturing the lion's share of them. And that's the beauty of the technology industry: Something new and exciting always emerges to take up the torch and lead the economy forward.

Disruptors need less babysitting than the disrupted

Another trend from the last decade was disruption. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk famously said on an earnings call in 2018 that ""moats are lame"" -- that a well-established and seemingly bulletproof business is no longer a good strategy. Innovation, especially that which is disruptive to the status quo, is the better route to go.

While many defend and still look to invest in businesses that are hard to disrupt, there's no denying that some of the best investments of the 2010s were technology stocks -- and specifically ones that changed business and consumer behavior (such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), for example). Many researchers and analysts agree that the world is in the early innings of another round of rapid societal change driven by technological advances. Dubbed the fourth industrial revolution by World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab, this new wave of advancement is being driven by internet mobility, AI, and automation. In other words, if you believe the world is and will continue to undergo rapid change in the years ahead, disruptive business models should continue to do quite well and cause headaches for those organizations slow to adapt.

While there are other ways to invest in an evolving economy and society at large (like businesses that are putting tech to work for them the most efficiently), tech stocks are the most direct route and purest play to get in on the movement.

Valuations aren't totally unreasonable

Of course, investors should still use discretion regarding which technology stocks to buy in 2020, or at any other time. Remember the tech bubble that popped during the early 2000s? Investors who didn't steer clear of bad internet-based companies with practically non-existent business results had a rough go of things for a few years.

As the saying goes, history rarely repeats itself, but it often rhymes. Many tech stocks do indeed look frothy once more after big double-digit returns in the last year, although with a twist this time around. Many upstarts -- software-as-a-service companies, most notably -- haul in quite a bit of revenue. However, to try and maintain their double-digit momentum, these companies pile their profits back into the business with aggressive sales and marketing efforts. Put simply, the strategy is ""grow now and profit later."" The payoff could be huge, but as 2019 demonstrated with many busted initial public offerings, the transition from maximum expansion to profitable expansion can be difficult (WeWork, anyone?). Know what you're buying, and understand a company's strategy to eventually get profitable before making a buy.

Still, it isn't all bad out there. The S&P 500 index currently trades for a lofty 25.2 times trailing-12-month earnings -- thanks in part to heavily weighted and premium-priced names like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google -- but the trailing-12-month P/E for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is just a bit over that, at 26.6. Speaking in relative terms, it's not a huge premium for the fastest-growing sector of the economy.

Thus, adding tech stocks to your portfolio in 2020 isn't a bad idea. Bear in mind there will be some bumps in the road this year, just as there have been in times past. Nevertheless, for investors who have time on their side (at least five to 10 years), buying technology will be a rewarding resolution to make."
5,0.9834,0.085,0.905,0.01,"Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is finishing off 2019 with one last impressive milestone. The company will begin delivering its Shanghai-built Model 3 on Monday, Tesla reported today. It's difficult to underestimate what an impressive feat this is. It was just 11 months ago that Tesla started construction of its newest Gigafactory in China.

""Local manufacturing is an essential component of our ability to provide to customers in [China] a truly affordable version of Model 3,"" Tesla said in a letter to shareholders in January, a few weeks after construction of the factory started. It didn't take long for Tesla to follow through. With Shanghai-based Model 3 deliveries starting before 2019 ends, the automaker will benefit from a major catalyst throughout 2020.

The China-made Model 3

Tesla first announced plans for its wholly owned Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai in July of last year. Since this announcement, the company's timeline has accelerated significantly.

When the factory was first announced, the automaker said it expected the first Model 3 vehicles to roll off the production line around mid-2021. But in Tesla's third-quarter update in 2018, management said it decided to accelerate its timeline in the market in order to make the Model 3 more affordable to its China customers. ""We are aiming to bring portions of Model 3 production to China during 2019 and to progressively increase the level of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing,"" Tesla said about its accelerated plans.

In an October 2019 update, Tesla said it was ahead of its revised schedule, with full vehicles already being produced ""on a trial basis, from body, to paint, and to general assembly, at Gigafactory Shanghai."" The company only needed to secure the necessary government licenses and approval to begin manufacturing and sales in the market.

Now it seems Tesla has received the last stamp of approval, with the Model 3 being listed as an approved new energy vehicle that is exempt from purchase tax.

A key catalyst

China is an important market for Tesla. Revenue from the country accounted for 8% of 2018 revenue. But there's significant upside, particularly with a China-made Model 3 going on sale.

""China is by far the largest market for mid-sized premium sedans,"" Tesla explained in its most recent quarterly shareholder letter. ""With Model 3 priced on par with gasoline powered mid-sized sedans (even before gas savings and other benefits), we believe China could become the biggest market for Model 3.""

With the Model 3 now accounting for more than 80% of global Tesla deliveries, it is by far the automaker's most popular vehicle. A competitively priced version of the car in the China market, therefore, could be a major catalyst for Tesla in 2020 and beyond."

Notably, NASA’s decision to open up the International Space Station for tourism and other private ventures from 2020 is a key catalyst in expanding the scope and market of space tourism.
Space Tourism Prospects Aplenty
Space tourism, also known as “citizen space exploration” or “personal spaceflight”, has become an attractive space due to strong consumer spending.
However, the biggest roadblock for the success of space tourism is the high cost of travel. Notably, a trip to the International Space Station will cost around $35K per day of stay while a return ticket will cost around $60 million.
The cost of getting into space will decline if the next generation of space planes can reach the orbit, making it an economically feasible option for a larger customer segment. This will also help the market to expand rapidly.
Per marketstudyreport.com data, cited by MarketWatch, the space tourism market is expected to be worth $1.18 billion by 2024, witnessing CAGR of 16.6% between 2019 and 2024.
This is why companies like Amazon (AMZN - Free Report) backed Blue Origin, Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) backed SpaceX, Virgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE - Free Report) and Boeing (BA - Free Report) are taking a number of initiatives to gain a foothold in this promising space.

7,0.9901,0.101,0.877,0.021,"Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have been on a tear recently. The stock is up 44% in the past six months. While the sharp rise is great for shareholders, it puts the pressure on for the company to execute during its fourth quarter. More specifically, investors should look for continued strong vehicle sales growth from the automaker to confirm that the automaker's growth story is intact.

Fortunately, there are several reasons for investors to be optimistic that Tesla can do exactly this.

Demand is increasing

Demand for Tesla's vehicles has steadily increased throughout the year -- and Q4 was no exception.

""Our global order rate remains strong and continues to increase,"" said Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn in the company's third-quarter earnings call. ""Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing, and quarter to date, orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.""

This bodes well for the company to hit its quarterly and full-year guidance. Tesla said it expected deliveries to increase sequentially and to exceed 360,000 for the full year. This means the electric-car maker will need to deliver over 104,500 vehicles in Q4 -- a figure that implies a 7% sequential increase. That would put total deliveries in 2019 significantly ahead of the 246,000 vehicles it delivered in 2018.

Word-of-mouth marketing is working

As has been the case for Tesla's previous vehicles, word-of-mouth marketing for Model 3 is proving effective.

""[W]hat we're seeing is that word of mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess of production. We have no plans to advertise at this time,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said.

Of course, Tesla does engage in significant sales efforts by opening stores in high foot-traffic areas, hosting occasional test-drive events, implementing referral programs, and utilizing other marketing tactics. Still, it's good to see Tesla reporting that word-of-mouth marketing remains a meaningful sales driver.

Model S and X deliveries may rebound in Q4

While Model 3 deliveries have been rising sharply, sales of Tesla's higher-priced Model S and X have been concerning. After averaging about 25,000 combined Model S and X deliveries a quarter throughout both 2017 and 2018, sales of the two vehicles have been dropped significantly in 2019. In Tesla's third quarter, for instance, combined Model S and X deliveries were about 17,500, down 37% year over year and 1% sequentially.

But Tesla management surprisingly indicated that deliveries of the two vehicles could move higher during Q4.

""[W]e are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand,"" said Kirkhorn during the call. He noted that while the Model 3's production ramp has consumed attention at the company up until this point, the recent stabilization of Model 3 production is allowing Tesla to focus more on the balance between its three vehicles. ""So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter,"" he explained. ""And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in Q4."""
8,0.9918,0.135,0.845,0.02,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared 30.7% in October, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the electric vehicle maker and power storage solutions leader announced better-than-expected third-quarter 2019 results.

Virtually all of Tesla's gains last month came in the two trading days following its Oct. 23 report. In that report, Tesla notably detailed a surprise adjusted (non-GAAP) profit of $1.86 per share -- smashing estimates for an adjusted loss of $0.42 per share -- despite an 8% revenue decline, to roughly $6.3 billion.

So what

Tesla set fresh records for both vehicle production and deliveries -- which grew to 96,000 and 97,000 units, respectively -- during the quarter. But it's top line shrank because the bulk of those unit sales (nearly 80,000) came from Tesla's lower-priced Model 3 sedan, deliveries for which soared 42% year over year, putting the company firmly on track to exceed the lower end of its ambitious goal for deliveries of 360,000 to 400,000 units.

Even so, Tesla was able to simultaneously reduce its operating expenses by 16% while generating a staggeringly better-than-expected $371 million in free cash flow (versus estimates for just $32 million) during the quarter.

Now what

If that wasn't enough, Tesla gave investors several reasons to be excited for what's to come.

For one, Tesla confirmed its Shanghai Gigafactory is now producing full vehicles on a trial basis as it awaits local government approval that should pave the way for ramped production at the Chinese facility. Tesla further teased that it believes ""China could become the biggest market for Model 3.""

And Tesla's vehicle lineup is poised to expand into two lucrative segments. First, Tesla said its Model Y compact crossover vehicle launch is ahead of schedule, with production now expected by the summer of 2020. Then, subsequent to last month's update, Tesla CEO Elon Musk separately confirmed the company will unveil its widely anticipated pickup truck model at an event on Nov. 21, 2019.

Finally, that's not to mention the potential for Tesla's new third-generation Solar Roof product, installations of which Musk has said the company hopes to ramp ""as fast as possible"" to more than 1,000 roofs per week in the coming months.

Of course, most investors know to take some of those promises with a grain of salt given Musk's history of setting audacious goals. But considering Tesla's massively improved operational efficiency in the meantime last quarter, it's no surprise that shares rallied in response last month."
9,0.9982,0.115,0.86,0.026,"Everybody's favorite electric vehicle (EV) stock is at it again, driving another substantial rally following its Q3 earnings. Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) shareholders are thrilled to see their investment make its way back into the $300s and towards its all-time high of $385. The stock has been bouncing between the low to mid $200s and high $300s for 3 years now.

The latest Tesla earnings release has driven it into one of the strongest and fastest rallies in the stock's history, and it doesn't seem to be slowing. TLSA could be well on its way to surpassing its all-time high.

Recent Activity

Tesla has a history of either misguiding analysts or leaving them in the dark regarding future quarterly results. This most recent quarter was no exception.

I sit here and think to myself, what are the possible reasons that an investor relations team would want such significant surprises in their earnings reports? The conclusion that I came to is that they want to keep TSLA relevant, and with huge swings in share prices from big headlines and big earnings surprises keeps TSLA at the forefront of traders' minds.

I know that traders looking for short term gains are only a small subset of the investor community. Still, it makes up a large portion of daily volume, and volatility increases volume, which in turn increases liquidity.

Regardless, this most recent earnings report proved to be a significant surprise on the EPS side of the equation. Analysts were expecting a sizable loss, but instead, the company demonstrated rich profitability. Some of this can be attributed to the hampered expectations from a disappointing Q2, and some could be attributed to an investor relations team that likes to keep the market guessing.

The biggest news coming out of Q3 earnings, from my perspective, is the ahead of schedule Shanghai Gigafactory. Ahead of schedule is something you rarely hear from Tesla, who has had a history of overpromising and under-delivering. This year may be the year that they finally hit their targets and keep their promises.

The enthusiastic and eccentric CEO Elon Musk promised to have 360,000-400,000 vehicles delivered by the end of fiscal 2019. This was something quickly shrugged off by investors, as this visionary's grandiose expectations are often unattainable.

Tesla has been able to deliver over 95,000 cars in Q2 and 97,000 in Q3, which were both record delivery figures for the company. If the company can deliver 105,000 vehicles in Q4, then it will have hit Musk's seeming unattainable guidance.

Shanghai Gigafactory

China is the largest electric vehicle market in the world by a substantial amount, almost doubling that of the US. Tesla's new Shanghai plant will give the company direct access to this market and allow them to cut costs substantially. In a letter to shareholders, Elon said that this factory was 65% cheaper than any Model 3 factory built in the United States.

The cost to the Chinese consumer will fall due to expect cost reductions and also allow the firm to bypass the tariffs associated with the US-China trade conflict.

The Gigafactory is currently in trial production and plans to have the plant fully operational this quarter. In phase 1, Tesla expects to be producing 250,000 cars for China annually and to reach its capacity of 500,000 units in the years moving forward.

The firm also said it would announce the location of its highly anticipated European factory by the end of the year — this is one more step for Tesla in its domination of the automotive world.

Some investors are still concerned about the steep competition in China, as well as signs of a global economic slowdown that would undoubtedly impact Tesla's sales.

Every major automotive company is working on some form of an electric vehicle, including companies like Toyota (TM - Free Report) , Ford (F - Free Report) , and General Motors (GM). These firms still have a long way to go before they are at the same level as Tesla, and by then, Tesla will be miles ahead.

Autonomous driving is the future of transportation, despite concerns with regulatory pushback. Self-driving electric vehicles are going to rule the roads of the future. Google's (GOOGL - Free Report) Waymo has been building out its neural-network for effective autonomous driving but it is still considerably behind Tesla, who already has around 800k vehicles on the roads with self-driving capabilities. Uber (UBER - Free Report) and Lyft (LYFT - Free Report) are also in the autonomous car race, as this would significantly reduce driver costs.

There is still a road of regulatory hurdles ahead before a car can legally drive on its own.

Recent performance

Tesla has been trading all over the board since the stock was introduced to the public markets in 2010. This trend of volatility has not faltered in recent years. From mid-December of last into early June, TSLA fell over 50%, to its lowest price in more than 3 years, due to liquidity concerns.

The stock bounced back on a $3 billion resurgence of capital from debt and equity sources, as well as record-breaking delivery figures. TSLA stumbled a little from a miss in its Q2 earnings report but quickly regained its momentum with another set record-breaker in quarterly deliveries. This propelled the stock into earnings, with gains of over 40% since the beginning of October.

Take Away

TSLA is driving returns for investors, and I expect this to continue as it slowly takes control of the global EV market. The company is now producing vehicles in China and soon will be producing them in Europe on its road to global automotive domination. This is a high-risk investment, but with high risk comes with high reward.

11,0.7476,0.058,0.889,0.053,"Going into 2019, Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) guidance for deliveries to increase 45% to 65% year over year in 2019 may have seemed unrealistic to some investors. After all, the automaker is up against a tough comparison. Vehicle deliveries soared 138% year over year in 2018. Furthermore, there were doubts at the beginning of the year about Tesla's ability to sustain Model 3 delivery volumes seen in the second half of 2018.

But Tesla has defied skeptics and is squarely on pace to deliver the 360,000 vehicles needed to hit the low end of the initial guidance range it laid out for the year.

Soaring Model 3 deliveries

Even for investors who were confident in Tesla's guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries in 2019, there was good reason for investors to doubt this target when the electric-car maker announced that its first-quarter deliveries slipped from 91,000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 63,000. Management said logistics challenges with the overseas expansion of its Model 3 were to blame.

But vehicle deliveries jumped to quarterly records in the next two quarters, led by rising sales of Tesla's Model 3. In Q2, Tesla delivered over 95,000 vehicles. Then quarterly deliveries rose to 97,000 in Q3. Record delivery volumes come even as Tesla's Model S and X deliveries have fallen sharply. That's because sales of Tesla's lowest-cost vehicle, the Model 3, have continued their sharp upward climb throughout 2019. Model 3 deliveries for the first three quarters of 2019 were about 51,000, 78,000, and 80,000, respectively.

With nearly 256,000 vehicles delivered so far this year, Tesla will need to deliver more than 104,000 total vehicles in Q4 to hit the low end of its guidance. And since production and deliveries have been steadily increasing as the year goes on, Tesla only needs to continue on the path it's on and avoid any major production setbacks.

Demand is rising

But what about demand? Even if Tesla can produce enough vehicles in Q4 to live up to its full-year guidance, will there be enough customer orders?

Based on what management said about order trends for its vehicles in Q3, demand should be sufficient.

""[W]e achieved record net orders in Q3 and are entering Q4 with an increase in our order backlog,"" Tesla said in its third-quarter update on vehicle production and deliveries. ""As was also the case in Q2, nearly all of our Model 3 orders were received from customers who did not previously hold a reservation, solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand.""

The main focus in Q4, therefore, is ""on increasing production to meet that demand.""

With vehicle production consistently rising, it's no surprise management is optimistic. ""We are highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year,"" management said in its quarterly update on Oct. 23."
12,0.9829,0.099,0.85,0.051,"For the stock market, the final week of October wasn't particularly one to remember. That's not so surprising, as this can often be a relatively quiet period for top stocks ahead of the shopping frenzy of Black Friday and the subsequent rush of the holiday period.

Most indexes this week ended up moving largely sideways, hitting a few dips and spikes on the way. Here's a look at two companies that ended more on the down side -- both traded down by around 4.5% over the five-day trading period. Perhaps we should consider buying one or both at their weakened prices.

Tesla

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of those stocks that always seems to get hit with bad news following a positive development or two. The most recent ding for the company was Friday's news that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a probe into battery fires that have erupted in Tesla's cars. Over the course of the week, Tesla stock declined by nearly 5%.

The investigation is the latest uncomfortable reminder that the company has safety issues more often than some think it should. Tesla's rather misleadingly named Autopilot feature has apparently been responsible for several fatal accidents, while the company has faced criticism that its safety claims are exaggerated.

The timing of the NHTSA's announcement wasn't fortuitous. It came barely a week after Tesla triumphantly announced its Q3 results, with headline numbers that positively crushed analyst estimates. It even featured that rarest of all occurrences for the company: a bottom-line profit.

I don't think the investigation into the battery fires changes the game much for Tesla stock. It's hardly the first time that the company's safety issues have hit the headlines, after all. And many of its believers and shareholders seem convinced that the cars are at least as safe as those made by rivals.

So investors shouldn't trade in or out of this stock based solely on this news. Personally, my opinion on Tesla hasn't changed -- I feel it's still a bit of a niche manufacturer in an industry where scale matters, and its management makes questionable decisions. I'm not bullish on the company as an investment.

Digital Realty Trust

Data center real estate investment trust (REIT) Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is feeling the urge to merge. Concurrent with its release of Q3 of fiscal 2019 results, the company said it has agreed to merge with European counterpart Interxion Holding (NYSE:INXN).

Effectively, Digital Realty is buying Interxion in an all-stock deal that values the latter at roughly $93.48 per share. This is only 4.5% above that stock's closing price on the day before the deal was announced. It also puts key Interxion valuations at around the same level as those of Digital Realty.

What Digital Realty stands to get for its stock is the second-largest data center business in Europe. Although that continent is nowhere near the size of the U.S., it's still a significant and high-potential region in the face of demand for ever-heavier data use.

This means that the price agreed in the deal is basically a bargain -- and this could actually be a problem. Market speculation has it that Interxion shareholders might not like being sold at that level, and vote against the deal in the hopes of getting more dosh (either from a rival suitor or from Digital Realty).

This fear seems to have impacted Digital Realty stock more than those aforementioned quarterly results, which were good, if not great. Revenue rose by almost 5% on a year-over-year basis to $806 million. This didn't meet analyst expectations of $813 million, but wasn't worryingly far below.

In terms of profitability, ""core"" (i.e., adjusted) funds from operations (FFO, the most important profitability line item for REITs) came in at $1.67 per share. That topped the average prognosticator projection by around $0.04.

I like the Interxion buy, as it's a smart and opportunistic move that makes Digital Realty a major player in the European market. Yes, Interxion shareholders might effectively agitate for a higher price -- and perhaps even initiate some kind of bidding war -- but since Digital Realty has made its offer exclusively in stock, it likely has room to add more to its offer.

I think Digital Realty will be successful in its courtship of the European company, which will make it even more of a commanding presence in the global data center space. I wouldn't be concerned about the slip in share price or the potential resistance to its current Interxion bid. Digital Realty is a solid operator, in my view, and its stock is a buy."
13,0.9973,0.106,0.858,0.036,"On its recent conference call with analysts, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was asked what he was most excited about in Tesla's future, aside from autonomous driving. Musk's answer may have surprised many, since the answer was Tesla Energy.

Tesla's energy segment is mostly an afterthought for investors, who remain focused on the company's automotive segment. This has been especially true as the Model 3 ramped up production over the past year. In the recently reported quarter, Tesla Energy only made up 6.4% of Tesla's total revenue.

Nevertheless, Musk devoted a fair amount of time on the last call to the energy segment, even bringing in Kunal Girotra, the senior director of energy operations to speak at length about how Tesla hasn't forgotten about its commitment to solar and renewable energy.

Musk and his management team made some interesting comments about the segment, with Musk even postulating that the energy segment could one day grow to be as large as the automotive business, which itself is set to grow significantly in the years ahead.

However, there's also reason to be suspect of Musk's motives for emphasizing energy at this time, given the timing of a recent shareholder lawsuit.

Earlier this year, several large Tesla investors were given class action status for their 2016 suit against the company, following Tesla's $2.6 billion acquisition of SolarCity. More recently, Musk was deposed, and numerous court documents were published at the request of the lawyers for the suing shareholders.

SolarCity was run by Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, and Musk was the chairman of SolarCity at the time. While he recused himself from voting on the acquisition, the recent court documents did show that he pushed hard for it in conversations with large investors. Documents also showed that Tesla's advisors would not issue a fairness opinion on the transaction, and that advisors for SolarCity sought alternative bids, but couldn't find a single one.

The lawsuit will likely continue for years in the future, but it's difficult to say exactly how successful (or not) the SolarCity acquisition will turn out. Tesla now groups the SolarCity installation business in with Tesla's home-grown storage division, including Powerpacks for utilities and businesses, and Powerwalls for home storage.

Still, the timing of Musk's deposition and the recently published court documents may have contributed to management's eagerness to tout Tesla Energy on the recent call.

How well is Tesla energy doing?

While it may not be a total disaster, SolarCity appears to have been a fixer-upper, at least. Under Tesla, solar deployments have decreased significantly, to a degree that likely wouldn't have been palatable for SolarCity as a stand-alone company. One year ago, Tesla even pulled the plug on a partnership with Home Depot, in which Tesla would have put a dedicated sales team in 800 stores.

That was done in order to streamline costs, as Tesla pivoted from selling SolarCity panels door to door to selling it in Tesla showrooms and online. Tesla also reportedly cut staff from the SolarCity division as part of its workforce reduction earlier this year and greatly decreased solar installations. For reference, Tesla only deployed 29 MW of solar energy in the second quarter of 2019, down sharply from the 84 MW deployed in Q2 2018 and 176 MW deployed in Q2 2017.

Still, Tesla did grow deployments sequentially in Q3 to 43 megawatts, reversing the quarterly trend of steadily decreasing deployments, though still far below previous-year levels. In the quarter, Tesla also came to market with several new solar features. These include:

A ""rental"" option in which a customer can easily deploy solar without an up-front fee or commitment to a long-term lease (though there is a $1,500 fee for removal).
A much faster time between ordering and install, down from weeks or months to a few days, as Tesla disclosed it can now set up solar in one visit in many cases, down from three visits on average.
A lower overall price, due to the company's sales and marketing cost reductions and standardized small, medium, and large modular system options.
A new generic template for housing authority approval, which has been accepted by 350 housing authorities and greatly streamlines the time and paperwork required to install solar over legacy custom forms.

Tesla also just unveiled the new version of its ""solar roof,"" which uses light-sensitive shingles that double as both a tile roof and photovoltaic solar panel. Tesla originally released the solar roof back in 2016 upon closing of the SolarCity deal, but had only installed a limited 31 solar roofs as of April. After the recent earnings release, however, Tesla released the third version of the solar roof, which Musk said, ""is finally ready for the big time."" Musk admitted that for versions one and two, the company was ""figuring things out.""

The new solar roof sports better safety and wiring, more density per tile, better edges that cut down on labor-intensive finishing, and, importantly, about half of the number of parts. Tesla claims the new solar roof 3.0 should now cost less than the installation of a traditional roof plus solar panels. Tesla will also be open to working with outside roofers in a certified program, in order to further streamline the costs of distribution.

Will it all work?

It's hard to know exactly what to believe, since Musk also made big promises three years ago when the SolarCity deal closed. One interesting excuse for recent solar declines was that Tesla had to divert most of its resources to the Model 3 launch, which is by far the most important product at Tesla, and one the company absolutely needed to get right.

On the conference call, Musk said the company diverted lots of engineering resources from the solar division to the automotive division to get the Model 3 right, after the initial production ramp-up ran into problems. However, now that the Model 3 production appears to have been fixed and is going quite well, he said, ""We've restored resources to Tesla solar and storage. And so that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into the future as I can imagine.""

While investors may be skeptical around the timing of the new solar announcements, Tesla did appear to prove skeptics wrong with the recent increased profitability in the automotive segment this year, so it's not unreasonable to think the solar and storage division could see better results in the future. However, investors should still be focused on the automotive division, especially autonomous features, the launch of the Model Y, and the Shanghai Gigafactory and Model 3 plants next year. Those big launches are still far more important to Tesla for the foreseeable future, despite the recent lip service given to Tesla solar."
14,0.9959,0.135,0.825,0.04,"Last week, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported a profit for the third quarter on Oct. 23, surprising analysts. The electric car maker reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, compared to the second-quarter loss of $1.12 per share.

Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk tweeted his take on the results:

Tesla Q3 results:
- Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule
- Model Y ahead of schedule
- Solar installs +48% from Q2
- GAAP profitable
- Positive free cash flow

— Treelon (@elonmusk) October 23, 2019

To understand Musk's spin, let's dig a bit deeper into those bullets.

1. Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule

Tesla says its new factory in Shanghai has already begun trial production runs. The factory was built in 10 months, and the company claims it was significantly less expensive to build than Tesla's Model 3 production system in the U.S.

2. Model Y ahead of schedule

The company also said it's ahead of schedule on its long-anticipated Model Y crossover. The Model Y was originally set to begin production in late 2020, but the company reports that the timeline has been moved up to summer 2020.

3. Solar installs +48% from Q2

Musk acknowledged that its solar business had been neglected as the company focused on making its Model 3 vehicle work for the sake of the company's health. But now that, as Musk says, the Model 3 is ""a relatively smooth operation,"" the company has redirected resources toward solar storage. Tesla said installations increased for the first time in a year. The 43 megawatts of solar deployed were a 48% jump from the previous quarter.

4. GAAP profitable

GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) refers to a common set of accepted accounting principles, standards and procedures companies must follow when they report their financial statements. What Musk is saying is that the company has returned to profitability because of strengthening margins and lower operating expenses.

5. Positive free cash flow

At the same time, the company generated positive free cash flow by, according to Tesla's press release, ""removing substantial cost from our business.""

Rough roads ahead?

Despite all this encouraging news, some signs indicate it could be time to pump the brakes. Reuters reported Tesla's third-quarter revenue in the U.S. fell 39%. That's the first time revenue in the U.S. dipped in more than two years. Sales in the U.S., which makes up the largest share of Tesla's total revenue, dropped to $3.13 billion from $5.13 billion last year.

TLF Capital analyst Ed McCabe, a vocal Tesla critic, called Tesla's earnings statement ""highly questionable."" He said the report hides a number of troubling figures and called the newest numbers ""not at all sustainable.""

A lot rides on whether Tesla's bet on Model Y will pay off. Forbes consumer tech reviewer Brooke Crothers dismissed imminent competition from traditional gas-engine car makers. ""The Tesla Model Y will dominate the EV [electric vehicle] crossover category because it's the most recognized EV brand -- certainly in the U.S,"" said Crothers. And the Model Y may drive the company's future success.

Tesla has more than the promise of Model Y going for it. Its price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio is -1.99, indicating that the stock may still be undervalued. And while Musk's characteristic zeal may scare off some investors, the company has started to deliver on his promises. It is meeting its production goals, delivering 97,000 cars in the U.S. in the third quarter, and it's ahead of schedule on its Shanghai factory and the Model Y.

With its history of innovation and as the U.S. continues to go greener, Tesla is a good bet for a long-term investment."
15,0.9977,0.108,0.876,0.016,"The shift toward adoption of electric vehicles (EV) is happening faster than expected globally and before long, investors could be looking at the mass adoption of these. In fact, as technological advancement and affordability of these cars substantially increase, one could consider investing in the growing global EV market to make the most of this revolution.

Automakers Investing Heavily in Fully Electric Vehicles

To begin with, automakers have already turned their attention to fully electric vehicles and taken key positions to invest in the segment. After all, the auto industry isn’t unaware of the popularity of electric vehicles, which is increasing because of rising demand for fuel-efficient vehicles and constantly mounting concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases.

In fact, Continental Aktiengesellschaft (CTTAY - Free Report) , a leading auto parts supplier, is already slashing its investments in conventional engine parts. The move comes because of a more-than-expected slump in demand for traditional engines as the industry moves toward electric vehicles.

The move isn’t limited to Continental Aktiengesellschaft alone. According to General Motors’ (GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra, over the next five years, the automaker expects to spend more on developing and selling EVs than gasoline-powered cars.

The EV Market is Expanding Faster Than Expected

The electric vehicle market is expected to witness a CAGR of 25.6% during the forecast period 2019-2026. By 2026, the market is estimated to reach more than $567.2 billion, according to Acumen Research and Consulting. In the EV market, hybrid electric vehicle is the largest segment that could witness maximum gains by 2026.

Secondly, the United States is a major shareholder in the EV market, owing to its high spending power, faster adoption of innovative technology and being home to the leading players in the concerned market.

After all, electric mobility is a fast-growing space. In 2018 alone, the global electric car fleet increased more than 5.1 million from the prior year, marking a steep rise of 2 million new vehicle sales, per an IEA report. Given the demand for electric vehicles, key players in the EV market are definitely well poised for gains.

So How Do Investors Benefit?

In order to make solid investments in the global EV market, one needs to look beyond automakers. Investors should also consider companies that manufacture vehicle components and supply key equipment to automakers. These include battery makers, power component suppliers and lithium suppliers.

For example, the most vital component of an electric vehicle is the battery. Therefore investing in Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY - Free Report) , which is one of the largest producers of lithium batteries globally, could be prudent. Similarly, one could invest in Albemarle Corporation (ALB - Free Report) , which is also a manufacturer of lithium compounds.

16,0.9963,0.101,0.855,0.044,"The automobile business is a very high fixed-cost business, which means that much of an auto manufacturer's costs come from its plant and equipment, which have to be maintained and updated. There are also high-wage technical personnel, who are often under union contracts. Therefore, when an auto company has high sales, much of that excess revenue falls straight to the bottom line. Yet when sales decrease, the opposite is true, and margins compress.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), however, managed to defy this automotive law of nature last quarter. In its recently reported third-quarter results, Tesla somehow managed to increase margins significantly, even as automotive and total revenue decreased. It's one of many mini-miracles the company has pulled off since Tesla, in 2003, became the first new U.S. automaker since 1956. Here's how the company did it.

Conflicting signals

Here are Tesla's results at both the automotive and company level, as it moved from the second to the third quarter:

Metric

Q2 2019

Q3 2019

Automotive revenue

$5,376 million

$5,353 million

Automotive gross margin

18.9%

22.8%

Total revenue

$6,350 million

$6,303 million

Total gross margin

14.5%

18.9%

Operating margin

(2.6%)

4.1%

As you can see, though Tesla's revenue went down, margins increased... by a lot. The magnitude of the margin increase is the result of great management on not one but several fronts.

First and perhaps most importantly, while Tesla sold fewer cars in Q3, it sold more Model 3 vehicles, its most important product. The Model 3 is a mass-production vehicle, so it benefits from higher volumes on top of its fixed-cost base. In Q3, Tesla sold 79,703 Model 3s, compared with 77,634 in the prior quarter.

Although Tesla actually lowered Model 3 prices, it pushed customers into more-expensive models since it lowered the price of the higher-priced longer-range vehicles even more than the lower-end standard range. This enabled the average selling price (ASP) of the Model 3 to remain flat in North America -- though ASPs for the Model 3 were lower in the Asia and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) regions. Still, a higher volume -- along with Tesla's ability to lower input costs through higher-volume ordering -- allowed a very impressive margin expansion, even for the low-end Model 3.

Though the company sold 239 fewer Model S and Model X vehicles in Q3, it did so at a higher ASP. In the second quarter, Tesla took various pricing actions on these vehicles, including heavy discounts for models produced before a new drivetrain and suspension were added in April. That had the effect of greatly decreasing ASPs in the prior quarter. Tesla also did away with Model S and X standard versions and lowered the price of more expensive, longer-range versions, which also had a positive effect on the overall S and X mix.

Though some investors maybe have been spooked when Tesla cut prices earlier this year, the strategy appears to have worked, by stoking demand and pushing customers into higher-end, longer-range models. The mix shift enabled by the pricing actions last quarter, along with Tesla's overall increased focus on cost-cutting and efficiency, allowed automotive gross margins to expand almost 4 percentage points.

Deferred revenue for self-driving features

In addition to the above production efficiencies, Tesla was also able to benefit from the introduction of its Smart Summon feature that it released during the quarter. Smart Summon allows owners to ""summon"" their Tesla to self-drive in a parking lot at low speed to pick them up.

Tesla has done a rather ingenious thing in the recent past -- offering various self-driving features to buyers before they were introduced, with the promise that these features will get more expensive over time. As such, Tesla has racked up about $500 million of deferred revenue that it has yet to recognize -- but it will as self-driving features are introduced through software updates. In the third quarter, Tesla was able to recognize $30 million that it had previously collected as cash as it introduced Smart Summon.

Other cost efficiencies

On top of these two important items, Tesla was also able to squeeze even more expenses out of its business. In its solar business, management noted increased efficiency as it can now install residential solar in a single visit, whereas it took about three total visits prior. Tesla was also able to cut costs around its service vehicles, as well as overall selling, general, and administrative expenses.

This general cost-cutting mindset allowed Tesla to not just lower operating expenses relative to sales, but even in total dollars, as operating expenses fell from $1.09 billion to just $930 million in the quarter. Though $117 million of the $188 million decrease was due to a non-recurrence of restructuring expenses taken in the second quarter, overall sales and marketing expense still declined by $51 million outside of this.

Finally, Tesla also got a slight benefit from foreign exchange, which sometimes works against it, but sometimes for it, as it did in this quarter. Tesla doesn't hedge its foreign-exchange exposure.

Blowing up the bears

The main argument for Tesla bears and short-sellers was that the company would never make money selling cars, and the company appeared to defy that thesis this quarter. Tesla has said that 2019 would be a year in which the company focused on cost-cutting, in preparation for its next stage of growth, fueled by the Model Y launch next year.

Even bears should be impressed -- and likely surprised -- by how much fat Elon Musk and his team have cut out of Tesla's operating structure. In the outlook in its Q3 report, Tesla said it expects, ""Positive GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] net income going forward, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp [up] of new products.""

There's still a valuation argument to be made against Tesla, but if the company can sustain GAAP profitability every quarter going forward, then a lot of reasons to short the stock are out the window. As such, it's no surprise to see Tesla's stock skyrocket on this news -- even if it did bring in slightly lower revenue."

From this look, the company’s future is quite favorable; as TSLA has earned itself a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), meaning that its recent run may continue for a bit longer, and that this isn’t the top for the in-focus company.

18,0.9964,0.126,0.811,0.062,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) has been trying hard to become a market dominator in the clean energy sector since 2016, especially after the acquisition of Solar City Corporation. Despite failing several times, finally it launched the Solar Glass Roof that seems to be quite promising. However, California’s raging wildfire and power cut might give a boost to the sales of Tesla’s Solar Glass Roof.

Rising Demand for Solar Panels and Roofs

As of Oct 25, more than 2 million people across California were affected by power outages. The utility companies are trying hard to find ways to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes and stop wild fire disasters.

The fragile, flammable nature of the power grid has instilled panic in residents not just in California but across the United States. Fire, which is still ravaging in the north of San Francisco, has engulfed more than 66,000 acres and is only 5% under control.

This phenomenon seems to occur every year and is exponentially increasing. However, after the 2018 camp fire disaster that had devastated the entire town of Paradise, electricity providers put the blame on camp fire.

But preemptive power outages have become consistent in California and the current outage is the second-most massive and deliberate blackout that is bothering Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers this month. In fact, over the past few years, the cost of grid electricity has either stayed constant or increased but service seems to be deteriorating.

Here’s where solar panels play a huge role. These panels generate energy and store it in batteries for household use. Households using solar power do not need to stay connected with the grid for electricity and are independent in times of these blackouts.

However, wildfire and power cuts seem to provide the perfect opportunity for Tesla. CEO Elon Musk twitted on Oct 28, “If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today.”

Will Tesla’s Solar Glass Roof Shine?

Tesla, on Oct 25, re-released it solar roofs, the third version of the product that was first launched in 2016. This product is not like other solar panels that need to be installed on the roofs, rather they are roof tiles that can send electricity into Tesla’s home batteries directly.

What’s the pocket pinch? As per Tesla’s website, the average price of a Solar Roof is $33,950 and its home battery system, the Powerwall, costs roughly $14,100 for a 2,200-square-foot home.

These V3 Solar roofs have larger tiles, higher power density, and new materials with a 25-year warranty. These textured glass shingles are hydrographically printed to resemble French slate or Tuscan glass. These tiles and roof installation have a warrantied power generation capability and protective weatherization (including 130 MPH wind resistance).

From recent history, Tesla’s solar roofs have been constantly failing since 2016. Per a CNBC report, Tesla hadn’t performed many actual installations of its solar roof tile since September 2018 . But Musk seems quite confident this time. On Oct 22, Musk cited American real estate listing website Zillow’s statistics that “homes with solar panels on average sell for 4.1 percent more than similar homes without solar panels.”

As mentioned earlier, solar panels when connected to batteries can offer independent energy, hence one can ride out blackouts. California’s power cuts caused by Pacific Gas & Electric’s poorly maintained power lines could last for another 10 years, hence a wide door for Tesla is open.

Tesla’s Solar Glass Roof is a long-term product expected to last 20 or 30 years. However, the company does not disown its solar panels as people who have constructed new houses in the recent past will surely not opt for a new roof right now. Also, Tesla is offering “cheaper-than-grid solar rentals” that can undercut energy bills.

The company hopes to install more than 1,000 roofs per week in the next few months and gradually independent installers will be able to sell and install the product themselves. With the subsidy to lower prices playing a crucial role in market dominance, Tesla seems to be positioned well.

However, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has many strong competitors. SunPower Corporation (SPWR - Free Report) , Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NOVA - Free Report) and ReneSola Ltd (SOL - Free Report) are just a few competitors from the long list who are watching Tesla closely and re-shaping their products to match up.

19,0.9731,0.104,0.82,0.077,"Back in August 2016, just days after Elon Musk revealed his plans to merge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with SolarCity, he followed up with the announcement of a planned product that would supposedly revolutionize not just solar energy but the whole roofing industry: the solar roof. The promise was that it would look and perform better than traditional roofing materials, and produce energy as well. That combination was intended to make the solar roof a no-brainer purchase for millions of American homeowners.

The problem was, Tesla never managed to manufacture or install the solar roof efficiently. It quietly developed a version 2.0 (which was never officially announced) and kept saying it was making progress, but it never sold enough of them to make a real impact on the solar market.

On Friday, Musk announced Solar Roof 3.0 and is promising to install 1,000 roofs per week. Should we believe him this time?

Tesla's core solar problem

In the years since Tesla bought SolarCity, it has actually been shutting down the solar business. It has laid off salespeople and installers, and shifted to an online sales model that has shown no sign of success. Quarterly installations have dropped from 258 megawatts (MW) at their peak to 43 MW in the third quarter -- though that was up from the second-quarter 2019 nadir of 29 MW.

In short, Tesla's solar infrastructure is now a shell of its former self. It no longer has thousands of installers with the expertise to install solar roofs, nor does it have the boots-on-the-ground sales staff to sell them.

Musk has yet to explain how the business will function in the highly competitive solar industry. Thus far, we've seen nothing but a decline in Tesla Solar, so whatever investments the company makes in training staff to install a complex new product aren't guaranteed to result in sales success. Musk has indicated that he's open to working with outside partners to install the solar roof, but hasn't signed any up yet.

Nor should we forget that neither of the previous iterations of the solar roof product succeeded in the market -- so there's a reason to be skeptical about this one.

Ready for prime time?

As Tesla begins to sell the Solar Roof 3.0, it won't be shocking if some homeowners feel a bit hesitant about turning their personal safety over to Tesla. Musk has made clear that a solar roof replaces the existing roof, rather than sitting on top of it. That means Tesla's electronics will be integrated with the home, and in particular the wooden roof substructure.

That's notable because Walmart is suing Tesla for gross negligence over fires at of its seven stores caused by its solar installations. Being associated with a fire hazard isn't good for Tesla's image, especially when it's launching a new product.

Given how fast Tesla is moving, it's also hard to imagine that it has done more than a few months of real-world testing, and it hasn't gotten any outside installers certified to install the solar roof safely. The company is asking customers to make a multidecade investment in a roofing product that has little testing behind it after two previous versions of the same product have failed to catch on and the same time that more traditional solar installations are catching fire (a problem other installers haven't faced). That's a tough pitch to make.

Musk's solar ""prove it"" moment

Once, the idea was that solar energy would be one of the pillars for Tesla's renewable energy business. Instead, the company's footprint in the space has been shrinking, and its efforts in both solar panels and the solar roof have been disappointments. Musk promises that this time will be different, and I hope he's right given how impressive looking the solar roof is. But before investors accept that the solar business can finally be a real money maker for Tesla, he's going to have to prove it."
20,0.9993,0.176,0.81,0.014,"The United States is expected to lean on non-hydro renewables -- namely, onshore wind and utility-scale solar -- for an estimated 10% of its total electricity in 2019. That may not seem like much, but it's up from virtually nothing at the start of the century. And the best is yet to come.

A combination of falling costs, improving technology, and supportive state policies make it likely that onshore wind and utility-scale solar will provide at least 30% of America's total electricity by 2030. But it's entirely possible that all renewable power sources -- including hydroelectricity, small-scale solar, and others -- could generate close to half of the nation's electricity by that date.

Getting there requires some help from two emerging technologies in particular: energy storage and offshore wind. Both opportunities are nearing an important inflection point, which means investors may want to the renewable energy stocks positioned to benefit on their radar.

Are batteries ready for prime time?

The promise of energy storage is simple to understand: Owners of wind farms and solar farms (or a rooftop solar array) could lean on batteries to smooth out the daily or weekly generation profile of their assets. For example, that could allow a solar asset to deliver electricity to the grid at night and incentivize larger solar farms, since energy storage could capture the ""overflow"" during the day. But residential and grid-scale energy storage products face a familiar obstacle: cost.

Discussing energy storage costs can be tricky because the economics depend on the application (small-scale vs. utility-scale, short-duration vs. long-duration) and the specific materials used in the device. Therefore, while energy storage only makes good financial sense for a limited number of applications today, there are signs that the technology is beginning to find ways into the crowded energy market.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) manufactures lithium-ion batteries for both small- and large-scale customers. It deployed a record 477 megawatt-hours of storage across all customer types in the third quarter of 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 99%. Most of the company's business comes from grid-scale projects, which may receive a big boost soon.

Tesla will begin delivering the Megapack, a 3 megawatt-hour battery for utility and industrial customers, in the fourth quarter of 2019. The size is important, but so, too, is the ability to manufacture it as a single unit. That will bring down the per-unit costs and has the potential to add significant growth to the company's energy storage business in 2020.

Meanwhile, an increasingly competitive residential market suggests energy storage is beginning to make financial sense for homeowners, too. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is preparing to launch its third-generation battery system, Encharge, which offers configurations of 3.3 kilowatt-hours and 10 kilowatt-hours. The lithium-ion based system is intended to be coupled with rooftop solar arrays and includes an inverter (the company's specialty), communications, and management software. The smaller unit is modular, allowing for systems to scale with a customer's needs.

Enphase Energy has high hopes for Encharge. The company estimates its foray into energy storage can increase the revenue per home from $2,000 today to over $10,000 in the near future. And as new products roll out, Enphase thinks it can tap into the entire global residential battery market by 2021, which is expected to be a 3,000 megawatt-hour opportunity that year with hypergrowth potential.

Can offshore wind keep its momentum?

The United States only has 30 megawatts of offshore wind power operating today, but the country boasts a pipeline of about 25,000 megawatts and could technically support over 10 times that amount. After a number of false starts and delays over the years, the nearly nonexistent industry appears to be finally picking up permanent wins.

The state of New York, which wants to have 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind spinning by 2035, recently sealed the deal on two projects totaling 1,696 megawatts: Empire Wind from Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) and Sunrise Wind from a company of the same name. Both are expected to come online in 2024 -- and investors will be watching them closely.

Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, has an ambitious long-term strategy that leans heavily on parlaying its offshore oil production prowess into offshore wind projects. It's off to a fast start. The company and a partner recently won an auction to build a 3,600 megawatt project off the coast of the United Kingdom, pushing its total offshore wind portfolio to 5,550 megawatts of owned and shared capacity.

Equinor sees a huge growth opportunity in the virtually untapped coastal waters of the United States, especially in the Atlantic, and is positioning itself to reap the first-mover advantage. But there's still a long way to go.

The contract for Empire Wind specifies electricity at just under $84 per megawatt-hour, double the price of onshore wind in the United States. While the cost for offshore wind should continue falling -- Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates the global average price fell 32% since 2018 -- the pace of the decline might determine how the potentially gargantuan U.S. market develops."
21,0.9984,0.125,0.846,0.029,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) just wowed investors in one of its biggest share price rallies to date, surging the stock over 30% since its Q3 report Thursday (October 23rd). This surge lost short-sellers over $1 billion, which initiated a ""short burn"" that lifted this stock back into the $300 range, but there is more to the story that could take this stock to new highs.

Analysts are increasingly optimistic about this stock and have continued to raise expectations and propelled TSLA into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It is reasonable to assume that these estimates will continue to rise as analysts adjust their models for the most recent company optimism.

Earnings Review

Tesla has a history of either misguiding analysts or leaving them in the dark regarding future quarterly results. This most recent quarter was no exception.

I sit here and think to myself, what are the possible reasons that an investor relations team would want such significant surprises in their earnings reports? The conclusion that I came to is that they want to keep TSLA relevant, and with huge swings in share prices from big headlines and big earnings surprises keeps TSLA at the forefront of traders' minds.

I know that traders looking for short term gains are only a small subset of the investor community. Still, it makes up a large portion of daily volume, and volatility increases volume, which in turn increases liquidity.

Regardless, this most recent earnings report proved to be a significant surprise on the EPS side of the equation. Analysts were expecting a sizable loss this quarter, but instead, they demonstrated sizable profits. Some of this can be attributed to the hampered expectations from a disappointing Q2, and some could be attributed to an investor relations team that likes surprises, up or down.

The biggest news coming out of Q3 earnings, from my perspective, is the ahead of schedule Shanghai Gigafactory. Ahead of schedule is something you rarely hear from Tesla, who has had a history of overpromising and under-delivering. This year may be the year that they finally hit their targets and keep their promises.

The overzealous and eccentric CEO Elon Musk promised to have 360,000-400,000 vehicles delivered by the end of fiscal 2019. This was something quickly shrugged off by investors, as this visionary's grandiose expectations are often unattainable.

Tesla has been able to deliver over 95,000 cars in Q2 and 97,000 in Q3, which were both record delivery figures for the company. If the company can deliver 105,000 cars in Q4, then it will have hit Musk's seeming unattainable guidance.

Shanghai Gigafactory

China is the largest electric vehicle market in the world by a substantial amount, almost doubling that of the US. Tesla's new Shanghai plant will give the company direct access to this market and allow them to cut costs substantially. In a letter to shareholders, Elon said that this factory was 65% cheaper than any Model 3 factory built in the United State's

The cost to the Chinese consumer will fall due to expect cost reductions and also allow the firm to bypass the tariffs associated with the US-China trade conflict.

The Gigafactory is currently in trial production and plans to have the plant fully operational this quarter. In phase 1, Tesla expects to be producing 250,000 cars for China annually and to reach its capacity of 500,000 units in the years moving forward.

The firm also said it would announce the location of its highly anticipated European factory by the end of the year — this one more step for Tesla in its takeover of the automotive world.

Some investors are still concerned about the steep competition in China, as well as signs of a global economic slowdown that would undoubtedly impact Tesla's sales.

Every major automotive company is working on some form of an electric vehicle, including companies like Toyota (TM - Free Report) , Ford (F - Free Report) , and General Motors (GM - Free Report) . These firms still have a long way to go before they are at the same level as Tesla, and by then, Tesla will be miles ahead.

Recent performance

Tesla has been trading all over the board since the stock was introduced to the public markets in 2010. This trend of volatility has not faltered in recent years. From mid-December of last into early June, TSLA fell over 50%, to its lowest in over 3 years, due to liquidity concerns.

The stock bounced back on a $3 billion resurgence of capital from debt and equity sources, as well as record-breaking delivery figures. TSLA stumbled a little from a miss in its Q2 earnings report but quickly regained its moment with another set record-breaker in quarterly deliveries. This propelled the stock into earnings, with gains of roughly 40% since the beginning of October.

Take Away

Tesla's surge from its Q3 report was more than just a short squeeze as the stock has continued to rally in the days following the report. As it stands, Tesla is now America's largest automaker. Many are rooting for this underdog story, with the values of innovation, and a greener planet being the catalysts. But, many are also betting against TSLA because of the overly positive narrative they believe has blinded investors and risen the stock beyond its intrinsic value.

Today, the reality is that Tesla is creating a brand for itself. It has become a very desirable good with quality distinguishing it from the inside out. The recent run-up does cause me some short-term share price concerns, but as a long-term play, TSLA is the automotive stock for your portfolio of the future.

22,0.9935,0.129,0.845,0.026,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) reported revenue of $6.30 billion, 3.28% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.52 billion. Earnings of $0.78 blew away the estimated $1.47 per share loss. So the big question is, where did that surprise come from?

Since revenue wasn’t a factor, it must have been cost reduction. Or efficiencies. Maybe both. Let’s see.

According to its press release, only 27 bps of the 393 bp sequential increase in automotive gross margin was attributable to regulatory credits. The rest was on account of “fundamental improvements” in its operating efficiency. And that included things like higher volumes (it delivered almost as many Model 3s as it produced in the quarter), manufacturing and material cost reduction, recognition of some Smart Summon-related deferred revenue, as well as FX.

Musk has been criticized for taking too long perfecting the manufacturing line, of not producing quickly enough, of missing production targets, of not generating profits or cash flow, of being inexperienced in car making and also of course for speaking his mind. To a certain extent, all of that is true. But it’s also true that his main problem was that he didn’t know how to deal with Wall Street. And these guys can be unforgiving.

He has consistently said that getting the fully-automated production line perfected was the first step toward getting the whole business in order and that is what I think we saw in this quarter.

And it isn’t just operating efficiencies. Since Tesla has so much innovation in the manufacturing line itself, the ability to perfect it will mean that it can set up these units faster, more efficiently and using less resources. That will mean even more cars on the road even quicker, creating a competitive edge over traditional automakers. Its Gigafactory in China for instance, is up and running in 10 months (trial vehicles being produced, manufacturing license and other regulatory requirements underway). Additionally, the Model Y production line is now being equipped and should be production-ready ahead of schedule, because of experience gained in its Gigafactory in China.

Another competitive edge that others may catch up to more easily is the mileage of a Tesla that is achieved through more efficient battery usage. The company says, “Our current shortest-range vehicle is on parity with the longest-range production EVs offered by other companies. Long-range models of each Model S, X and 3 continue to have 20-40% higher range than any other EV available.” That is a bold statement and is no doubt one of the reasons why Teslas remain so hot, even when customers could do with easier access to service.

The other high point of the quarter was positive cash flow. Musk said a number of quarters back that the company would be cash flow positive in quarter three. How exactly it got there, whether through restructuring, cost cutting, ramping production or whatever is less relevant. But delivering on big promises means that the company is finally finding its groove. It sort of proves the business model and the execution, increasing confidence in the stock.

24,0.9999,0.13,0.843,0.027,"A number of factors are set to drive the solar energy industry for decades to come. The world's middle class is growing rapidly. Humanity's impact on the Earth's climate has shifted the momentum away from fossil fuels and solidly toward renewable energy options like solar. Technical improvements and massive manufacturing scale have combined to drive costs down to the point where solar can be as cheap as fossil fuels in many parts of the world. Simply put, investors who are ignoring or avoiding solar stocks are missing out on a generational opportunity to invest in one of the most important parts of the world's energy industry.

Discovering that the solar stock opportunity exists is easy. The tougher part is identifying the best solar stocks that make sense for your financial goals and your portfolio. A broad swathe of companies are involved in solar, ranging from huge multinational manufacturers to small, pure-play solar panel installers, with a litany of combinations in between.

To help you get your footing in the solar industry, keep reading for a breakdown of the various kinds of companies that fall under the ""solar stock"" description, what makes them unique, and a brief description of the 13 biggest solar stocks that trade on U.S. stock exchanges.

Here are the 13 biggest solar stocks

These are the 13 companies trading on U.S. stock exchanges that are heavily involved in the solar industry, sorted by market capitalization (a company's total shares outstanding multiplied by the stock's market price).

As the table above shows, a wide range of companies of various sizes are involved in solar, ranging from small, pure-play solar panel installers to large, diversified global companies that count on solar as only part of a much bigger business.

What is a solar stock?

A solar stock is a company that counts the solar industry as a significant portion of its current business, is quickly growing its solar business, or its solar business plays a major role in the solar industry. This is why you'll see companies ranging from Tesla, which generated $25 billion in sales in its trailing four quarters, to tiny Vivint Solar and its $301 million in revenue over the same period, pegged as solar stocks. On the one hand, Tesla's solar installation business is a very small part of its overall results. But within a few years, its solar panel manufacturing and energy storage systems business units could prove to be far bigger. Moreover, even though it's a small part of Tesla as a whole, its solar and energy storage segment is much bigger than Vivint's entire business.

Add it together, and you'll find a wide array of companies in the 13 we have identified. Moreover, their diversity can make a big difference in what kind of investor each company is suitable for. Here's a closer look at the kinds of solar stocks out there and what makes them unique.

The different kinds of solar stocks

The solar energy business is dynamic, with companies filling a variety of roles across manufacturing, installing, maintaining, and operating solar panel systems. There are also different niches within solar, including distributed solar on residential and business rooftops -- utility-scale solar systems that generate power for the grid. The big takeaway is that not all solar stocks are the same, and what makes for a good fit for one investor may not be ideal for someone else.

(For your reference, here's a guide for how to invest in solar energy stocks.)

Solar panel manufacturers

Solar panel manufacturers design and make solar cells that are then assembled into the solar panels you see on rooftops or in solar farms. In general, solar panel makers focus on delivering the most-efficient panel possible at the lowest possible cost. Two important terms you'll see used by solar panel makers are efficiency and cost per watt. Efficiency -- shown as a percentage measure -- describes how much sunlight a panel can convert into electricity, so higher is better. Cost per watt is a more important metric, because generally, the more efficient a panel is, the more expensive it was to produce. That creates a higher cost per watt. And at the end of the day, most solar panel buyers -- whether residential, business, or utility companies -- want to get the most power production for their money.

Of course, cost isn't the only driver behind which panels are the best choice. For instance, higher-efficiency panels can be the best choice in certain space-limited applications, such as rooftops. In those cases, paying a premium to get more power from a smaller space might make sense. Additionally, how much power a panel will generate over its lifetime is an important consideration. Solar panels gradually lose efficiency over time, and different operating environments can affect output as well. Some of the top panel manufacturers differentiate themselves by making solar panels that work better in extreme temperatures or maintain higher efficiency over their usable life.

Solar system installers

Solar installers are the companies that work with residential and business customers looking to buy solar panels. Solar installers help customers design a system that meets their power needs, sell the solar system to the customer (or otherwise help them lease or finance it), and play a role in providing service and maintenance during the life of the system.

While many solar installers are small, local operations, there are a growing number of larger publicly traded solar installers that are steadily expanding their operations across the country.

Solar component and accessory manufacturers

In addition to solar panels, there are specialized components that are used to optimize the power and to convert -- technically in vert -- the direct current (DC) electricity from solar panels into the alternating current (AC) power that the grid operates on. There are a few small, pure-play companies that focus on these products, as well as related components for charging electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

Yieldcos and utilities

Yieldcos are the companies that own and operate utility-scale solar power plants. Typically, they are the subsidiary of a larger company (in some cases a utility), but often a larger organization that may own and manage other large infrastructure assets. While some yieldcos own regulated utility assets, they also may operate independently, making money by selling ""wholesale"" electricity to utility operators that use that electricity to meet customer demand.

The ""yield"" part of the yieldco name comes from the way these businesses are structured, which is to generate a generous dividend yield for their investors. Those dividends are covered by the predictable cash flows they generate from their utility operations or long-term contracts to supply electricity to power companies. Like utilities, a high-quality yieldco should also be a relatively recession-resistant investment; people and businesses still rely on electricity no matter the state of the economy.

Does that sound similar to a utility company? Well, it should, because they have comparable business operations. The difference is, utilities are stand-alone entities while yieldcos have a sponsor company that is usually a majority investor. The other possibility is when the yieldco is structured as an LLC or limited partnership and has a controlling interest, such as being the general partner. The important part to remember is that, with yieldcos, investors would do well to understand not just the yieldco but also the company behind it to make sure you have aligned interests and to ensure that the sponsor has a track record of solid business performance.

Without further ado, let's take a look at the baker's dozen of solar stocks above, grouped by category.

The biggest solar panel manufacturer stocks

First Solar

The biggest solar panel maker by market capitalization, First Solar's main business is making and selling solar panels that are used in utility-scale projects. The company also develops and builds utility-scale solar projects and then typically sells them after they are brought on line, though it recently announced that it would exit the engineering, procurement, and construction business. This move is intended to help First Solar focus more narrowly on the two things in which it has been a leader: making solar panels for utility-scale applications and developing utility-scale projects.

First Solar has two important competitive advantages that make it a compelling business.

First, its thin-film solar panels give it an advantage over the crystalline silicon panels its competitors make, particularly in the high-growth utility-scale solar market. First Solar's thin-film technology generates more consistent power output across a varying range of temperatures. Since utility-scale solar installations are often located in places with extreme temperatures, power producers need to know they can predict the amount of power a solar farm generates. First Solar wins a lot of business because its panels will often outperform crystalline silicon panels that may have similar efficiency or cost-per-watt ratings.

Second, First Solar has -- by a wide margin -- the strongest balance sheet of any publicly traded solar panel maker. Through the second quarter of 2019, the company had $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $481 million in debt. Carrying more than four times as much cash as debt gives First Solar a number of advantages over its competitors, including more resources to deploy to improve its products (which it consistently has) and a much bigger margin of safety to ride out the ups and downs of solar panel demand.

The combination of a dominant technology in utility-scale solar and a super-strong balance sheet is why First Solar is worth $6 billion as of this writing, more than the other three solar panel makers listed here combined. That's true, even though JinkoSolar ($4 billion) and Canadian Solar ($3.2 billion) generated significantly higher revenue than First Solar's $2.5 billion in sales over the past year.

SunPower

While First Solar is a leader in solar panels for utility-scale applications, SunPower's high-efficiency solar panels give it some competitive advantages in residential and commercial applications. Over the past decade, few solar panel makers have come close to matching the efficiency levels of the company's panels. Simply put, SunPower's panels generate far more electricity on a size-for-size basis than anyone else.

Unfortunately, this technological advantage hasn't translated into big gains on the bottom line. SunPower's high-efficiency panels cost more to produce on a cost-per-watt basis than lower-efficiency panels from competitors that compete on cost, and the advantages of higher-efficiency panels simply haven't been enough to justify a higher selling price. This has caused the company to regularly generate some of the lowest gross margins in the space.

The company is working to innovate its way out of this low-profit pattern. SunPower's A-Series panels are its most efficient ever, while also offering a number of other benefits that make them, according to the company, cost-competitive with its commodity-focused competitors. SunPower has completed a number of major investments in its global manufacturing footprint that have started paying off in 2019, but investments to bring A-Series to market at scale are planned in 2020.

SunPower is also a leader in energy storage, with its Equinox system for residential users, and Helix battery system for commercial energy users. This should help the company remain the leader in the U.S. in commercial solar, where it has the No. 1 market share position, and to continue taking share in residential, which it counts on for about one-third of its sales. SunPower's $1.67 billion in annual sales is easily the smallest of these four companies, but its strong position as a leader in the U.S. residential and commercial markets, along with the prospects of its A-Series panels and energy storage products, makes it one of the most-valuable solar companies in the world.

Canadian Solar

Canadian Solar has some of the biggest manufacturing scale of any publicly traded solar panel manufacturer in the world. Through the second quarter of 2019, it had more than 12 gigawatts (GW) of solar panel assembly capacity, and 9.3 GW of solar cell assembly capacity. Moreover, its scale has paid off. The company expects to ship 8.4-8.5 GW of solar panels in 2019, helping drive its profit margins steadily higher as its operating leverage increases.

Founded in Canada but with most of its manufacturing capacity in China and Southeast Asia, Canadian Solar has taken a decidedly different approach than its two peers discussed above. It is building massive manufacturing scale and focusing on developing the lowest-cost panels it can make. The result are panels that operate at lower efficiency levels than those of SunPower or First Solar but compete with anything else on the market on price. Coupled with the company's project development business, and Canadian Solar is a global behemoth in utility-scale solar that should generate close to $4 billion in sales in 2019.

JinkoSolar

JinkoSolar is the only other publicly traded solar panel manufacturer that rivals Canadian Solar in manufacturing scale, with almost 13 GW of solar panel manufacturing capacity. However, it's even more vertically integrated than Canadian Solar, with about twice the wafer (a key part of the solar cell) manufacturing capacity than its rival, which uses suppliers for more of these components.

That higher level of vertical integration pays off during high periods of demand. As the chart shows below, JinkoSolar's operating results improved substantially from 2018 to 2019, as demand ramped up and the company's business model helped it achieve higher operating leverage.

On the other side of the coin, weak demand in the past has caused JinkoSolar's results to deteriorate rapidly because of the high fixed costs of operating such a massive, integrated manufacturing operation. However, the solar panel manufacturing space has undergone a lot of consolidation in recent years, in large part due to weaker competitors getting put out of business. This should result in a healthier market for the biggest companies to compete across the demand cycle.

The biggest solar installer stocks

Tesla

Best known for its popular electric vehicles, Tesla is also a major player in several parts of the solar industry. To date, its biggest business has been installing residential and commercial solar systems following its acquisition of SolarCity. But since acquiring what, at the time, was the largest solar installer in the U.S., the company has drastically reduced the size of its sales and installation business in what has proven a relatively unsuccessful attempt to integrate solar panel sales with its Tesla retail operations.

While it's been shrinking the solar installation business, Tesla has made major investments in solar panel manufacturing. The company is promising a product it is branding as the ""solar roof,"" which would act as both the solar panel and roofing material, replacing conventional shingles, tile, or metal slats. But like its efforts to change its other parts of sales and marketing in this industry, the solar roof has been very slow to reach commercial development.

Thus, we have a large installer business that's shrunk substantially since Tesla acquired it, and a solar panel manufacturing business that's yet to deliver the commercial products promised. There's a solid case to be made that, pending some major development that changes the trajectory of these businesses, Tesla's solar business could be hurting the company more than it's helping.

So, while it has a bigger market cap than Sunrun or Vivint Solar, Tesla's actual solar business is now smaller than both of its two installer competitors, and the panel manufacturing business has yet to prove it can add value at scale so far.

But if there's a segment of the solar business (in fairness, it's bigger than just solar) where Tesla has established itself as a leader, it's in energy storage. Tesla makes the Powerwall residential battery system and the Powerpack and Megapack commercial and utility battery systems. For Tesla, energy storage is a natural fit. The company is already one of the biggest lithium battery makers in the world as part of its electric-vehicle manufacturing business. Producing storage systems that can meet applications ranging from a residential property with a handful of solar panels to a utility-scale project that can power thousands of homes is an excellent fit within Tesla's core strengths.

Whether the company can find a winning approach to return its solar panel installation business to growth or make something profitable from a solar panel manufacturing business that's yet to deliver meaningful returns remains a big unknown. But even if those businesses don't pan out, Tesla's role as a battery supplier will likely play a major role in solar's growth in the next decade.

Sunrun

Unlike the much-bigger Tesla that only counts on solar for a small -- and, unfortunately, shrinking -- part of its business, Sunrun is a pure-play solar installer. The term ""solar installer"" is a bit of a misnomer because it only covers part of what Sunrun does and how it makes money.

Sunrun's business is to provide homeowners and businesses with multiple ways to acquire a solar system. The company sells solar systems to buyers who plan to purchase it outright or to use a third party for financing, but the bulk of its business comprises long-term contracts called power purchase agreements, or PPAs. With a PPA, Sunrun actually maintains ownership of the solar system, selling the customer the power it generates on a long-term contract that's generally 20% or more cheaper than buying power from the local utility. These contracts are typically 20 years in length, require no money down, and make it more feasible for many buyers to go solar.

There are advantages to the PPA model. The first and most obvious one is that it makes solar more accessible to more homeowners since it requires no up-front cost and the homeowner will see an immediate payoff in the form of lower energy costs. Additionally, PPAs have the potential to be more profitable. Not only can the company realize a higher price for the power sales (often with annual increases) than it gets by selling panels directly, but it also retains the substantial federal tax credits as the owner of the solar system.

The thing is, it takes a lot of capital to operate this model. The solar panels, mounting hardware, and other components have to be purchased, installers have to be paid, Sunrun has to cover all its other operating expenses, and it has to make a profit. And since the stream of cash flows from PPA customers comes over 20 years, Sunrun must come up with a lot of cash up front to cover its expenses and pay for the solar equipment it installs for customers.

To do this, the company sells the tax credits and other tax benefits to other companies and takes on a substantial amount of debt.

The result is a balance sheet that can look more like that of a utility company than what you'd expect of a company that sells and installs solar panels.

But over the long term, the expectation is that Sunrun will benefit from signing more and more PPA agreements, as the recurring cash flows it earns from electricity sales gets bigger and bigger over time. To help demonstrate the value of these expected future cash flows, the company reports what it says is the retained value of these future cash flows, in a metric it calls net earning assets.

Net earning assets, in short, are a combination of the stream of payments it has contracted, plus estimates for revenues it will earn from contract renewals, minus its debt and certain other future obligations. Through the most recent earnings report, the company said it held $1.4 billion in net earning assets or $12 per share.

However, investors should consider that number with some caution: Only $300 million of that total is cash flows that will be generated from existing contracts. The $1.1 billion balance is based on the company's estimates for contract renewals. The risk here is that those solar systems will be 20 years old come renewal time, and most will generate far less electricity than they did when they were new. There's a lot that can change between now and two decades away to potentially undermine that $1.1 billion figure.

That doesn't mean investors should avoid Sunrun. On the contrary, it's well run and one of the biggest and best-known solar installers with a solid business model. The biggest takeaway is that investors should factor Sunrun's valuation heavily into their investment decision.

Vivint Solar

There are a lot of similarities between Vivint Solar and Sunrun. Both have similar business models, helping customers design and acquire a solar panel system and then installing it and maintaining it. Both will sell you a solar system but count on PPA agreements and operating leases for the majority of their sales and cash flows (both current and future). Moreover, Vivint's business model is also predicated on the use of a substantial amount of debt and tax equity to fund operations today while building up a multibillion-dollar stream of cash flows that will roll in over the coming decades.

Where the two are a little bit different is in their estimates of future cash flows from renewals. Through the second quarter of 2019, Vivint reported $2.12 billion in gross retained value. Of that amount, $532 million -- or 25.1% -- is in renewal estimates. Sunrun, on the other hand, has a bigger $3.3 billion in gross earning assets (its name for retained value), but $1.1 billion of that -- 32% -- is from renewal estimates.

In other words, a much bigger portion of Sunrun's net retained value is based on projecting a higher percentage of its customers will keep their 20-year-old solar systems than Vivint Solar is projecting. Simply put, there's more risk baked into Sunrun's math.

Additionally, Vivint seems to be creating more retained value with less leverage. Through the second quarter of 2019, Sunrun says it will retain 43% of its gross earning assets, while Vivint Solar will keep more than 55% of its gross retained value. In other words, Vivint Solar's net retained value metric is a more conservative number, and it is likely to hold on to an even larger portion of gross retained value after paying other obligations.

Put it all together, even though Sunrun is the bigger solar installer, Vivint is doing a better job of creating long-term shareholder value.

The biggest solar component and accessory makers

SolarEdge

SolarEdge has established one of the strongest footholds in the solar industry, supplying inverters and power optimizers that help solar users generate the most consistent, reliable, and cost-effective electricity from their solar installations. Its technology has helped it to establish itself as a market leader, with more than 13 million power optimizers and a half-million inverters over the past 12 months. Sales are up 122% since 2017 on the back of the compelling performance/price offering that its power optimizers and inverters bring.

The company isn't just winning business on price. Even as its sales have grown at double-digit rates, SolarEdge sports some of the best gross margins in the industry, well above 30% in recent quarters. Management has kept the business strong with an enviable balance sheet that features far more cash than debt and its operations generate strong operating cash flows.

One of the most compelling things about SolarEdge, frankly, is that its management isn't just resting on its laurels as a major solar component supplier. The company has made major investments over the past several years to expand its business into differentiated, but related segments of the renewable energy industry. This includes acquisitions in the electric-vehicle drivetrain market, EV recharging systems, and battery backup and energy storage system manufacturing.

While not all directly related to solar energy, there is substantial overlap in all of these markets, and management is counting on the company's expertise and the overall growth of renewable energy demand to help it leverage the total renewable energy opportunity in the years to come.

With a strong core business, a great balance sheet, and an excellent track record of execution by its executives, SolarEdge is positioned for many more years of growth.

Enphase Energy

Like SolarEdge, Enphase has established itself as a leader largely by being very good at one thing and leveraging that to command as much market share as it can. In Enphase's case, that one thing is microinverters. These devices set the standard for on-panel electronics that deliver the most reliable and efficient output for a solar installation. Since the start of 2018, Enphase has seen its sales grow 41% on strong demand for its microinverters, particularly for distributed residential solar.

Enphase's growing market share is helping improve the bottom line. In the first half of 2019, its gross margin increased from 28% to 34% through a 60% jump in revenue, and it generated $25 million in operating income and $32 million in operating cash flows. The two operating measures improved from a loss in the former and a 327% increase in the latter.

Enphase is also taking a play from the SolarEdge playbook to some extent, if in a much more focused way. The company has made energy storage a key part of its plans for the future, in both distributed residential and small-scale commercial solar. Enphase is betting big on this space and plans to leverage its already-dominant share of the microinverter market to be a big player in residential energy storage. Battery prices have fallen dramatically over the past five years, and the percentage of home solar installations that include battery storage is accelerating rapidly.

Just how big is the U.S. residential solar opportunity alone? In the first four decades of residential solar's existence, approximately 2 million solar systems were installed. Most estimates say it's only going to take four years to install the next 2 million residential solar systems. For Enphase and its peers, the best is yet to come.

The biggest solar utilities

NextEra Energy

One of the largest utility companies on earth (and easily the biggest company on this list worth well over $100 billion), NextEra Energy is the dominant electricity provider in Florida through its Florida Power and Light and Gulf Power subsidiaries. The utility's NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary, which produces and sells power to other utilities, is the biggest producer of solar and wind energy in the world. Simply put, NextEra is a behemoth in renewables, including solar.

Recently, the company has accelerated its investment in renewables, taking a novel approach to combine both wind and solar together in a single project with energy storage to maximize resources and returns. This includes a facility with 300 MW of wind and 40 MW of solar tied to 30 MW of storage, resulting in both clean and stable electricity for users. It recently went even bigger with a project in Oklahoma, that included 250 MW each of wind and solar, with 200 MW of battery storage. These two recent projects are great examples of where wind and solar, combined with battery storage, can compete with fossil fuels on cost. In these cases, renewables proved to be cost-competitive with natural gas peaker plants to meet high-peak energy demand reliably.

Moreover, NextEra is banking on the operational costs for solar and wind to continue to fall. On the second-quarter 2019 earnings call, CFO Rebecca Kujawa said that the company expects ""... firm wind and solar to be cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear, and less-efficient oil and gas fire generation units even after the tax credits phase down early in the next decade."" She went on to emphasize that cheaper renewables, paired with storage, would become ""increasingly disruptive"" to current fossil fuel generation in the U.S.

Looking into the future, this giant utility is as well positioned to participate in the growth of solar.

The AES Corp.

Unlike NextEra, with its large regulated utility operations, AES makes a living generating power that it then sells and distributes to utility companies and large industrial customers. In some ways, that makes it like a stand-alone version of NextEra Energy Resources. Also like NextEra, AES considers solar a major part of its business. Since the end of 2015, AES has grown renewables from 23% of its generating capacity to 30% at the halfway point of 2019. The company is also on track to generate almost half of its power from renewables by the end of 2022. Solar is going to play a substantial role in that transition; 56% of its renewables pipeline is solar projects.

And that transition isn't expected to come at a cost to investors. On the contrary, the company expects to grow adjusted earnings per share from 7% to 9% per year on average during that period. Combined with a solid dividend, that would result in a total return between 10% and 12% per year.

The biggest solar yieldcos

Brookfield Renewable Partners

While it counts on hydroelectric power for the great majority of its cash flows today, Brookfield Renewable has made both wind and solar its biggest priority for future investment. This transition is a product of the change in the cost curve of these technologies in recent years. In short, Brookfield Renewable changed its strategy when it became apparent that companies could make money generating and selling power from wind and solar panels.

With the backing of Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), there's no better endorsement for solar as a viable and profitable endeavor going forward than Brookfield's long history of delivering profits across just about every economic environment.

Over the next five years, Brookfield Renewable plans to spend $4 billion on renewable projects, with solar likely to be featured heavily in that mix. Those investments are expected to generate enormous returns, too. Management anticipates cash flow per unit -- partnership-speak for per share -- to increase between 9% and 16% annually through at least 2024. Historically, Brookfield Renewable has used cash flow growth to fund dividend increases at a double-digit rate on average. If it reaches the cash flows growth projected, investors should be able to count on similar -- or maybe even higher -- payout growth in the future.

TerraForm Power

It has already been noted that Brookfield Renewable is savvy at making profitable investments, and TerraForm Power is an excellent example. Since Brookfield Renewable bought a majority stake in TerraForm Power several years ago and made major changes in its management and operations, TerraForm Power has been a real bright spot in the yieldco universe. Not only have its existing operations stabilized, but under new management and with a better-capitalized partner behind it, the company has reinstated its dividend and started growing it cash flows again.

TerraForm Power operates over 4 GW of power generation in North America, Europe, and Latin America, and counts solar as a major part of its business. Since the start of 2019, the company has grown solar from 35% of its capacity to 41%, and projects solar will account for 52% of total revenue in 2019.

Looking at the long term, TerraForm Power, like other Brookfield-owned entities, is likely to generate steady, and regular returns for investors. It aims to grow its dividend payout 5%-8% every year, while keeping its payout ratio around 80%-85% of cash flows. By retaining as much as 20% of cash flows, it can both maintain a solid margin of safety for the payout while also having some capital to fund future growth initiatives.

TerraForm's history prior to Brookfield's involvement isn't great. But as a member of the Brookfield family today, it's likely to be a top solar stock for years to come, especially for investors looking for a reliable high yield and strong prospects for dividend growth."
25,0.9993,0.184,0.79,0.026,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged into profitability in the second half of 2018, buoyed by rising deliveries of its Model 3 midsize sedan. However, the company plunged back into the red in the first two quarters of 2019, even though it achieved a new delivery record in Q2. Price cuts and unfavorable mix shifts from the pricey Model S and Model X toward the Model 3 -- especially cheaper versions of the Model 3 -- drove this profit reversal in the face of record volume.

Tesla hit a new delivery record last quarter, but it just barely surpassed its Q2 delivery total. This made it seem like another quarterly loss was in the cards. Instead, Tesla surprised investors with a solid profit for Q3, driven by significant cost reductions.

Revenue falls, but Tesla posts a profit

Tesla generated $6.3 billion of revenue last quarter, roughly in line with analysts' expectations. This was down slightly from the second quarter and down 7.6% from $6.8 billion in the prior-year period.

Management noted that most of the revenue decline compared to Q3 2018 was driven by an increase in the mix of leased vehicles. (Tesla recognizes the revenue from a leased vehicle over time rather than at the time of sale.) That said, revenue would have fallen regardless of this factor, despite a 16% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries, because of a mix shift toward lower-priced vehicles.

While revenue fell both sequentially and year over year in the third quarter, Tesla returned to profitability. Operating profit reached $261 million and net income reached $150 million. Both of those figures represented year-over-year declines but substantial improvements over the second quarter of this year. Excluding stock-based compensation costs, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.86, whereas analysts had expected a small loss.

Cost reductions are the key

There were several factors behind Tesla's unexpected return to profitability last quarter. For example, foreign exchange gains accounted for nearly half of the company's GAAP pre-tax profit. In addition, Tesla booked $30 million of deferred revenue because of the U.S. release of its ""Smart Summon"" self-driving feature.

However, the most important factor was impressive cost discipline. Automotive gross margin rose to 22.8% from 18.9% in the second quarter. A stronger mix drove some of that improvement, but more efficient production operations also had a big positive impact.

Furthermore, Tesla reduced its selling, general, and administrative expenses to $596 million from $647 million in Q2 2019 and $730 million in Q3 2018 while also holding R&D spending roughly flat. Impressively, it was able to do so while also boosting order activity globally, preparing to launch volume production at a new plant in China, and speeding up the timeline for introducing the Model Y crossover.

This strong cost performance bodes well for the future. If Tesla can execute its ambitious growth plans successfully over the next few years while keeping spending in check, the company would be in line for phenomenal margin expansion.

Tesla is on the right track -- but don't believe all the hype

In light of these strong quarterly results, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was back to his usual optimistic self on the company's earnings call on Wednesday afternoon. During the course of the call, he made a series of bold -- and in some cases, thoroughly outlandish -- claims about what's next for Tesla.

For example, Musk predicted that the Model Y will sell better than the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined, all without cannibalizing any sales from those other models. He also said that Tesla's output would more than triple within a few years, thanks to the opening of new production facilities in China and Europe. In fact, he claimed that Tesla could eventually build 20 million vehicles a year, nearly double current market leader Volkswagen 's 2018 sales volume. Finally, Musk opined that Tesla's energy business could one day be similar in size to its automotive business.

For those keeping score at home, these claims add up to an absurd prediction that Tesla's annual revenue could rise to as much as $2 trillion, albeit in the distant future. For comparison, revenue is on track to come in around $25 billion this year.

Luckily for bulls, Tesla can fall well short of Musk's goals and still achieve incredible growth in the years ahead. To be sure, the company may face meaningful headwinds. A slowdown in the Chinese auto market and anti-U.S. sentiment in China related to the ongoing trade war could offset the benefit of starting local production in that key market. Rising competition in the electric vehicle market combined with slowing auto sales in much of the world could also threaten Tesla's growth trajectory. Nevertheless, Tesla's long-term profit growth potential looks a lot better now than it did just a week ago."
26,0.9953,0.197,0.784,0.019,"What happened

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 9.5% on Friday. The stock's gain follows an even bigger gain on Thursday. Shares are up nearly 29% in two days.

Optimism for the stock over the last two days follows the company's surprise third-quarter profit. The company's bottom line and free cash flow were both much better than expected during the period.

Friday's gain, specifically, is likely due in part to news that several bearish Tesla analysts raised their price targets for the stock, as well as a continuing short squeeze as short-sellers cover their short positions.

So what

Tesla's third-quarter revenue was about in line with analyst estimates. But its non- GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share came in at $1.86 -- far ahead of analysts' average forecast for a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.42. In addition, management reiterated that it believes its business has scaled to the point of being self-funding.

Following the surprise profit, some analysts with the lowest price targets on Tesla stock lifted their outlooks. Barclay 's analyst Brian Johnson increased his target from $150 to $200; Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy boosted his target from $189 to $200; and JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman boosted his target from $200 to $220. Their price targets, of course, still imply downside from the growth stock 's current price of $328. But an improved outlook from prominent bears may have spooked some short-sellers and prompted them to cover their positions.

Now what

For now, Tesla will need to execute well during its important holiday quarter. In order for the company to achieve its guidance to deliver 360,000 or more deliveries during 2019, the automaker will need to deliver about 105,000 vehicles during the period. This would be a quarterly record for the company.

Looking further out, Tesla will have to prove that it can remain profitable and truly be able to self-fund its business."
27,0.9968,0.182,0.797,0.022,"Major benchmarks moved higher on Friday, lifted by continued strong results for the majority of companies reporting third-quarter earnings. Geopolitical and macroeconomic issues have faded into the background as investors have largely paid attention to issues at the individual-company level, and on the whole, businesses have seen solid results in recent months. Some companies saw their shares continue to gain ground on several types of good news. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (NYSE:IPOA), and ResMed (NYSE:RMD) were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well.

Tesla stays in high gear

Shares of Tesla rose 9.5%, adding to their big gains from Thursday following the electric-vehicle manufacturer's surprise profit in the third quarter. Analysts weighed in with their opinions on Friday, with pros at Barclays raising their target price by $50 per share. Barclays still has doubts about Tesla's long-term prospects, and it kept its underweight rating on the stock. Moreover, its new target of $200 per share is still well below the current stock price. Yet even the bearish analyst company acknowledged that it's hard to go against overwhelmingly positive investor sentiment on Tesla in the short run, and with some bullish institutional investors keeping their positions in the automaker, it's possible further share-price gains are yet to come.

Virgin Galactic to come public through Social Capital Hedosophia

Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings stock climbed 11% as investors prepared for the special purpose acquisition company to help Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic go public. Social Capital Hedosophia has already gone through the IPO process, but by acquiring a stake in Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company will be able to gain access to regular investors directly without doing what most companies do prior to initial public offerings. Space tourism has a lot of potential and plenty of risk, but investors have been happy with Branson's past successes and are hopeful that Virgin Galactic will pay off in the long run for early shareholders.

ResMed looks healthy

Finally, shares of ResMed gained 13%. The medical device specialist said that fiscal first-quarter revenue and adjusted net income both rose 16% from year-earlier levels. ResMed saw particular strength in its software-as-a-service segment, which benefited from the acquisition of electronic health records specialist MatrixCare. Sleep apnea has been an area of concern in the healthcare community lately, and the company's innovative devices have been instrumental in helping patients confront the disease. ResMed expects to help a quarter billion people make their lives better by 2025, and the company's already well on its way toward reaching that goal."
28,0.9961,0.142,0.8,0.059,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) soared after it reported third quarter earnings where it raised cash and increased its margins. Tesla posted just its fifth quarterly profit since going public in 2010, after accumulating a loss of more than $6 billion so far. Since the company was formed, investors pointed to a few persistent problems like a large debt load, sales boosted by government subsidies to buyers, and consistently missed production forecasts.

Elon Musk’s antics are also highlighted as a problem as the sometimes-eccentric behavior the Tesla CEO exhibits has people scratching their heads. The electric car company seems to have made the right adjustments in Q3, but will those adjustments be permanent solutions?

The question on everyone’s mind after Tesla posted $1.86 per share and $6.3 billion in revenue is: can Tesla keep this up or will the rollercoaster ride continue? Sustained profitability has been on every investor and analyst’s radar when examining Tesla, and this latest report gave investors a nice surprise.

“Skeptics had legitimate concerns in the past, but Tesla is now building cash, winning market share, and boosting margins - all while preparing to launch products in untapped segments and regions,” Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter said in a note to investors after the results. Tesla also shared photos of its new factory in Shanghai where the company says its already begun trial production runs.

The company also said it was ahead of schedule on its long-awaited Model Y crossover, which it now expects to launch by next summer. At the same time, Tesla says it is planning to make a limited run of its Tesla Semi truck next year, and hopes to soon announce the location of its European Gigafactory, where it aims to begin making electric vehicles in 2021. Additionally, in Q3, Tesla released over-the-air software updates including the Smart Summon Feature, which allows Tesla drivers to remotely call and control their cars.

Investors with short positions on the company are feeling the heat after its latest report as they lost about $1 billion on Thursday. Has Tesla finally bested the investors betting against it, or are they not out of the woods yet? Well, the road that lies ahead for the company is anything but a cake walk.

The company needs to deliver at least 104,800 cars in the fourth quarter to meet the low end of its 2019 forecast of 360,000-400,000 vehicles. On top of the daunting number of vehicles it must deliver to reach its forecast, federal tax credits on electric vehicle purchases are set to expire at the end of this year, which can have an adverse impact on the business.

The company is often accused of spending too much to fuel its growth trajectory which is why Q3’s 7% top-line decline was worrisome to some analysts. The bulls contend that Tesla should be valued like a momentum tech name, making its revenue a crucial metric when examining the company. If the company’s revenue growth continues to decline, bullish investors may cut their losses and flee.

Takeaway

For the time being, Tesla short sellers are feeling the heat from the company’s latest surge but some still feel the company is destined to see its valuation plummet. Tesla has its work cut out for it next quarter if it wants to keep the pressure on the 20% of its stock that is being shorted.

The slowing automotive market and decelerating global economy are additional headwinds that Tesla will need to deal with to close out its fiscal year on a high note. The Tesla bulls won this round, but the fight over how to value Tesla will continue next quarter.

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped on Thursday, rising as much as 19.7%. As of 11:47 a.m. EDT the stock was up 16.6%.

The stock's gain follows the company's third-quarter results, which featured a surprising profit. In addition, the company's free cash flow was much higher than anticipated.

So what

In its third quarter, the electric-car company reported non- GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $1.86 -- well ahead of an average analyst estimate for a loss per share of $0.42. Free cash flow similarly crushed analyst estimates, coming in at $371 million. On average, analysts had expected Tesla to report free cash flow of $32 million.

Another quarter of meaningful free cash flow helps ease concerns about the automaker's ability to be self-funding. The company has now reported positive free cash flow in four of the past five quarters, with trailing-12-month free cash flow of $975 million.

Now what

Looking ahead, management said it expects full-year deliveries to exceed the low end of its guidance range laid out at the beginning of the year for 360,000 to 400,000 units. The low end of this guidance range implies 45% year-over-year growth in deliveries.

In addition, management had upbeat news on its Shanghai factory, noting that trial production of the Model 3 is underway. Further, Tesla said it expects its Model Y to launch by summer 2020."

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.86 in contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents. In the year-ago, the company had reported earnings of $2.90 per share. However, revenues of $6.30 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.52 billion and also came in lower than the year-ago figure of $6.82 billion.
Earlier in October, Tesla revealed that it had delivered record 97,000 (79,600 Model 3 and 17,400 Model S and X) vehicles, higher than 84,000 vehicles delivered in the year-ago quarter. However, the number fell short of the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet of 99,000. The electric carmaker said that it achieved ""record"" net orders in the third quarter and is seeing an increase in its order backlog in the current quarter (read: ETFs to Watch as Tesla Misses on Q3 Deliveries).
Overall, Tesla is expected to deliver 360,000-400,000 vehicles in 2019, indicating growth of 45-65% from 2018. It hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles a year globally in the 12-month period ending Jun 30, 2020 and reaffirmed a target of producing 10,000 vehicles per week by the end of 2019. The company also continues to target 25% non-GAAP gross margin on Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles.
The electric carmaker said its Shanghai Gigafactory is ahead of schedule with trial production underway. Model Y production is expected to begin by summer 2020.
After delivering a profitable quarter, shares of Tesla increased nearly 21%, crossing $300 for the first time since Mar 1 in aftermarket trading. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of C, suggesting outperformance in the days ahead though it belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 30%).

The company is highly confident in exceeding 360,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019. Importantly, it expects positive quarterly free cash flow as well as net income, in the upcoming period, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp-up of new products.

32,0.9939,0.146,0.793,0.061,"Following a worse-than-expected second quarter this summer, when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) missed both top- and bottom-line forecasts, investors were watching the automaker's third-quarter update closely on Wednesday afternoon. Specifically, they were looking to see if higher Model 3 deliveries in Q3 compared with Q2 would help or hurt the company's financials.

Tesla delivered -- and then some. Its bottom line swung from a loss in the second quarter of 2019 to a meaningful profit in Q3 as its automotive gross margin strengthened sequentially. In addition, Tesla's free cash flow was far ahead of what analysts were expecting.

Shares are soaring, up more than 20% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as of 6:10 p.m. EDT.

Tesla's Q3 results

Third-quarter revenue came in at $6.3 billion, in line with analysts' forecasts but down from revenue of $6.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell despite a 16% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries. The decline was primarily due to the introduction of a leasing option for the Model 3. About 6,500 of the cars were subject to lease accounting during the quarter, up from zero in the year-ago period.

Tesla's net income for the period was $143 million, down from $312 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2019 was $342 million, down from $516 million in the third quarter of 2018.

Despite net income falling on a year-over-year basis, the period's profitability took The Street by surprise. Analysts feared outsize growth in the company's lowest-cost vehicle -- the Model 3 -- would weigh on earnings. Model 3 deliveries accounted for 82% of the quarter's deliveries, up from 67% in the third quarter of 2018. On average, analysts were expecting Tesla to report an adjusted loss per share of $0.42. Yet non-GAAP earnings per share for the period were $1.86.

Highlights

Capturing Tesla's recent operational progress, non-GAAP earnings per share swung from a loss of $1.12 in the second quarter of 2019 to a profit of $1.86. In addition, Tesla's automotive gross margin also improved nicely on a sequential basis, rising from 18.9% in Q2 to 22.8%. Even when excluding the impact of regulatory credits, Tesla's automotive margin improved by 366 basis points.

Free cash flow for the period was $371 million, crushing a consensus analyst estimate for free cash flow of $32 million.

Looking ahead

Going into the year, Tesla said it expected to deliver between 360,000 and 400,00 vehicles, representing 45% to 65% growth. Many investors had doubts as to whether this target was achievable. Yet with just over two months left in the year, the company says it's on track to exceed 360,000 deliveries in 2019.

Importantly, Tesla reiterated that it continues to believe it has grown its business to the point of being self-funding. While management says profits and free cash flow could suffer any time Tesla is bringing new products to market and is ramping up production of those products, it expects to be profitable for the most part from here on out.

Regarding future products, the company said it's expecting to launch its Model Y this coming summer, with limited production of its Tesla Semi coming sometime next year as well."
33,0.9823,0.087,0.889,0.024,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.86 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.15 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.90 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1,340%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric car maker would post a loss of $0.54 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.12, delivering a surprise of -107.41%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

Tesla, which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, posted revenues of $6.30 billion for the quarter ended September 2019, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.28%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

Tesla shares have lost about 23.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 19.5%.

While Tesla has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Tesla was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $7.06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$3.20 on $24.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Domestic is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1."

But, today three big-brand American stocks are poised to come up with promising earnings results. These stocks possess stable cash flows and have established business models, which will certainly boost their profit margins.

Let us, thus, take a look at some of the big-brand companies set to beat earnings in one of the busiest earnings stretches this season.

MSFT - Free Report) is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2020 results, after market close. The biggest cloud computing company has impressed investors with solid growth in the past decade. In fact, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the company’s revenues jumped 12% year over year, courtesy of an uptick in commercial cloud revenues.

During the fiscal fourth quarter, commercial cloud revenues soared 39% year over year. In particular, Azure cloud platform’s revenues climbed 64% annually. Azure’s encouraging growth is expected to have continued in the fiscal first quarter.

Other segments of commercial cloud including Office 365 and Dynamics 365 are also expected to have driven the software giant’s earnings. Needless to say, Microsoft’s commercial Office and Dynamics’ revenues increased 14% and 12%, respectively, on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter.

The PC industry, by the way, is doing pretty well this year. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments increased 3% annually in the third quarter to 70.4 million. Another research firm Gartner also estimated a 1.1% rise in PC shipments to 68.1 million. Thus, it’s expected that Microsoft has made the most of the increase in PC sales in the fiscal first quarter.

Analysts now expect the company’s EPS to increase to $1.25 from $1.14 a year ago. Revenues are expected to jump from $29.08 billion to $32.23 billion. Presently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.31%.

Microsoft’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.7%, in contrast to the Computer - Software industry’s projected decline of 0.5%. What’s more, the company has outperformed the broader industry so far this year (+34.3% vs +29.8%).

Tesla

Elon Musk’s Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) will report its third-quarter results after the closing bell. The electric car company has of late shown impressive growth in vehicle sales, mostly driven by its low-cost Model 3. But, the question is whether the low-priced vehicle will be able to single-handily boost the company’s profit margin.

Tesla has announced that it has delivered a record 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter, and almost 80,000 of these vehicles were Model 3. Such figures are, undoubtedly, higher than any other quarter so far. What’s more, production has gone up with nearly 10,000 more vehicles in the second quarter.

Wall Street analysts expect the company’s third-quarter revenues at $6.6 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter loss per share has also been narrowed by 2 cents in the past 30 days. And our proprietary model predicts an earnings beat for Tesla this time around. Tesla has an Earnings ESP of +79.68%.

Tesla’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 127.8%, way higher than the Automotive - Domestic industry’s projected rally of 1.3%. The company has outpaced the broader industry in the past month (+14.5% vs +4.9%).

Ford

Ford Motor Company (F - Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter earnings after the closing bell. The iconic U.S. car manufacturer has seen its shares experience a volatile phase, especially after earnings releases this year. Its shares jumped more than 10% after first-quarter earnings release, while the stock lost more than 7% following second-quarter numbers. So, all eyes are now on third-quarter earnings results to track the stock’s movement post release.

Its vehicle sales have slightly declined in the United States this year. Tight supplies of the 2020 Explorer SUV have been cited to be the primary reason behind this decline in sales figures. But, investors shouldn’t worry! Ford stated that sales in the European market, led by Focus, rose 3.1% in the third quarter. In comparison, Ford lost nearly $245 million in the European market in the same period last year.

Ford also stated that its sales in China were up 5% in September from August and 25% compared to July. Most importantly, its Lincoln brand’s September sales jumped 11% and 13% from August and July, respectively.

The promising sales performance hints at a solid third quarter for Ford. The Zacks Consensus Estimate, Ford for the company’s EPS is pegged at 26 cents on revenues of $34.17 billion. Ford currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.74%.

Ford’s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a steady 3.2%. Most importantly, its stock price has surpassed the Automotive – Domestic industry on a year-to-date basis (+18.5% vs +3.2%).

35,0.9854,0.084,0.872,0.044,"The car company that is driving the electric vehicle (EV) revolution is preparing to report its earnings after the bell Wednesday, October 23rd. Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) has traded all over the board with anything from positive headlines to disappointing earning hurling this stock one way or the other. The recent positive market sentiment and lowered expectations lead me to fancy this stock as a buy before earnings.

Q3 estimates have dropped significantly since the last earnings report. Zacks Consensus estimates illustrate an EPS of -$1.40 on sales of $6.6 billion. This would represent a drop from profitability and a year-over-year sales decline of 4.5%.

TLSA estimates have historically been exceptionally wrong. Q3 of last year, this company beat EPS estimates by 200%, revealing a strong profit when analysts were expecting a substantial loss. Revenues also beat estimates by north of 20%.

TSLA is a big mover on earnings with an average price movement of 8.2% over the past 10 quarterly reports. This is due to the ostensibly unpredictable quarterly results and investor relations team that either doesn’t know what to expect or wants investors to be surprised. My guess is the latter.

I think the company wants to keep analysts and investors in the dark before earnings and big headlines because this keeps the stock relevant. The unpredictability of TSLA makes it a trader’s bane, and at the same time, they can’t stay away, keeping liquidity high.

The most recent rally, which began this summer, was initially a bounce back from the liquidity concerns, which were alleviated with a capital infusion along with a record number of vehicle deliveries in Q2 (95,200 cars). Tesla was able to raise almost $3 billion in an equity and bond offering in early May.

TSLA had fallen to the lowest levels the stock had seen in over 3 years, and the reversal was sharp, as short-sellers exited positions and savvy investors saw this as an undervalued equity. Following the robust vehicle delivery figures in June, the share price surged further. The stock rallied almost 50% in a month and a half after its low into earnings. TSLA missed big on its Q2 earnings, which led to another stock break down.

This breakdown only lasted a month, and we are now back up to the $250 level, which this stock has historically bounced off. The $250 level is represented below in a 3-year chart by the red line. Investors can’t stay away from TSLA when they see a price they like. This stock is also prone to trend trading (until it’s not), meaning that it has big run-ups and run-downs.

TSLA’s October rally is due to its record-breaking delivery figures. The EV firm delivered an astounding 97,000 cars in the 3 rd quarter. Elon’s over-ambitious delivery forecast of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries may still be attainable if the company can deliver 105,000 in the 4 th quarter.

This boost in investor sentiment could be a good trend trade into earnings, which is expected after the bell tomorrow.

Shanghai Gigafactory

Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, China, is going to change the game for the electric vehicle maker. US automakers are going to be subject to a 50% import tax. Tesla’s new domestic Gigafactory will shield it from this tax and give the company direct access to the largest electric vehicle market in the world.

The new factory is expected to start production this quarter and looks to be on schedule, something that is rare for Tesla. The company is anticipating to make 250,000 cars per year in Phase 1 and eventually reach its capacity of 500,000 vehicles produced annually.

If the project can be completed with no hiccups, this will solidify the firm as a global EV leader. China buys more than double the number of electric cars of any other single country, and Tesla’s direct access to this market should proliferate its sales.

Take Away

TSLA has momentum behind it before going into its Q3 earnings report. The positive headlines that we have seen over the past quarter lead me to believe that this could be a positive earnings. Estimates have dropped substantially since its disappointing Q2 earnings and expectations are low. This could provide a springboard for this stock to be thrust back into the $300s if this report can display positive results.

Look for any changes in management guidance on China operations as well as domestic. Bear in mind that guidance has historically been erroneous, though it still shifts market sentiment. With negative earnings expected, a significant beat on either metric could yield TSLA investors and traders some substantial gains, and vice versa.

37,0.996,0.118,0.857,0.025,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is likely to trump earnings estimates when it releases third-quarter 2019 results on Oct 23, after the closing bell. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is a loss of 12 cents per share on revenues of $6.6 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter loss per share has been narrowed by 2 cents in the past 30 days.

The electric vehicle maker recorded wider-than-expected loss in the last reported quarter amid lower-than-anticipated automotive revenues. Precisely, automotive revenues in the second quarter came in at $5,376 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,458 million.

As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Tesla displays a dismal record of missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. This is depicted in the graph below:

Our proprietary model predicts an earnings beat for Tesla this time around, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +79.68%. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.

Zacks Rank: Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. A Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Factors Setting the Tone

Rising Model 3 delivery, which forms a major chunk of the automaker’s overall deliveries, is likely to have aided Tesla’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Strong performance and impressive design of its products are expected to have ramped up sales volumes. While Tesla didn’t reach its 100,000-car delivery target, the automaker’s third-quarter deliveries hit a new quarterly record. Notably, the company delivered 97,000 vehicles globally in the third quarter, up from 83,500 units in the year-ago period. Model 3 deliveries in the quarter came in at 79,600 units, up 42.5% year over year.

The company’s energy generation and storage revenues for the soon-to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been robust mainly due to the storage business. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $434 million, suggesting an uptick from $399 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the consensus estimate for service and other revenues is pegged at $611 million, indicating a 87% year-over-year increase.

Record deliveries in the third quarter, aided by Model 3 sales, and improved performance of the firm’s energy and storage business are likely to have buoyed earnings for the to-be-reported quarter.

Other Stocks to Consider

Tesla is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies, which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.

American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL - Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to release third-quarter 2019 earnings on Oct 24.

Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS - Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2019 earnings on Oct 24. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.34% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT - Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2019 earnings on Oct 24. The firm has an Earnings ESP of +1.39% and a Zacks Rank #3.

38,0.9756,0.176,0.798,0.026,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.
That is because Tesla is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TSLA in this report.
In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 3 cents per share for TSLA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TSLA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +79.68% heading into earnings season."
39,0.9952,0.138,0.845,0.017,"Earnings season is in full swing. And these next few weeks, in particular, will feature a broad array of reports from high-profile stocks. While investors obviously can't tune in to every earnings report, two worth watching will be Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Chipotle has come into the spotlight this year as the company's operational execution, digital initiatives, and menu innovation have helped comparable restaurant sales beat expectations. Meanwhile, investors will be watching to see whether Tesla's higher Model 3 sales are finally helping the company become sustainably profitable.

In Chipotle's second quarter, revenue jumped 13.2% year over year. Fueling this strong top-line growth was a 10% increase in comparable restaurant sales, or sales at stores in operation for at least 13 full calendar months. This extended a trend of accelerating growth in this key metric to a sixth consecutive quarter.

Given the company's strong momentum in the first half of the year, the company updated its outlook for comparable restaurant sales growth, forecasting growth in the high-single-digit percentage point range. This is up from a previous outlook for comparable restaurant sales growth to rise by a percentage point in the mid- to high-single-digit range.

Investors, therefore, should look for the quarter's comparable restaurant sales growth to be in line with management's full-year outlook for the metric.

The company has a number of key initiatives that are probably helping grow sales at existing stores, including the company's new rewards program, new menu items, and streamlined mobile ordering.

Investors can tune in to Chipotle's third-quarter update on Tuesday, Oct. 22, after the market closes.

Tesla

Electric-car maker Tesla has already reported its third-quarter deliveries. Total deliveries during the period came in at a record 97,000. That's up from about 84,000 deliveries in the year-ago period. The Model 3 accounted for all of Tesla's growth in vehicle deliveries, representing 82% of deliveries -- up from 57% in the year-ago quarter.

The big question Tesla investors have, however, is whether the company's rapidly growing sales of Model 3 are helping or hurting profits. In other words, investors will be looking to see whether Tesla achieved positive net income in Q3.

Since the vehicle has a much lower price point than the Model S and Model X, it's unclear whether the electric-car company has achieved the economies of scale needed for its Model 3 sales to help the company become profitable. Management certainly expected that to be the case when it reported its second-quarter results; Tesla said its business ""has grown to the point of being self-funding."" In addition, the company noted that it was aiming for positive net income in Q3 and beyond. But management added that ""continuous volume growth, capacity expansion, and cash generation will remain the main focus"" -- not GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) profitability.

Tesla is reporting its third-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, Oct. 23."
40,0.992,0.136,0.792,0.072,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is set to report its third quarter results after the closing bell Wednesday, October 23. The electric car company has had a rough year, as shares are down more than 23% in 2019 and significantly lagging behind the auto market’s 8.1% rise. Investors are skeptical whether or not the company’s Model 3 will be able to become the product that can finally help the company become consistently profitable.

The lower price of the Model 3 vehicle has some investors believing it will be the X factor for Tesla, but others believe that the Model 3 can cause Tesla’s gross profit margin to contract and ultimately hinder the automaker’s bottom-line. Let’s take a closer look at the company and how they might come out of the gates in Q3.

Do Bullish Investors Still Have a Case?

While Tesla didn’t reach their 100,000-car delivery target, the 96,000 cars they did deliver in Q3 was a new quarterly record for the automaker. 96,000 is an impressive number for a company that typically needs to work with a niche consumer market in a capital-intensive industry. Despite the challenges stacked against the company, bigger automakers like Ford (F - Free Report) and General Motors (GM - Free Report) are trying to catch up to Tesla in the electric vehicle market.

Some investors believe that Tesla will be able to flex its premium brand and report a 25% gross profit margin on its automotive business. This target is impressive because it's about the same gross profit margin that Tesla had on its higher-priced Model S and X sales before Model 3 production and deliveries ramped up.

Outlook

If Tesla can reach this target and sustain it while the Model 3 grows and becomes a larger part of the firm’s total revenue, then it would indicate that the production of the Model 3 is seeing improved efficiency. However, gross profit margin has moved in the wrong direction lately. The company’s automotive gross margin peaked in the third quarter of 2018 at 25.8%, it decreased to 24.3% in Q4, 20.2% in Q1, and 18.9% in Q2. This can indicate that Tesla's gross margin is spiraling downwards as Model 3 deliveries increase.

Our consensus Q3 estimates forecast Tesla’s bottom-line to plummet 104.14% to a loss of $0.12 per share while sales slip 3.25% to $6.6 billion. The services and energy generation and storage segments are expected to make respective gains of 87.2% and 8.58%. Total automotive revenue is projected to fall 9.76% to $5.5 billion.

Looking ahead to Tesla’s full fiscal 2019 figures, our estimates forecast the electric car company to see earnings crater 127.82% to a loss of $3.03 per share while sales grow 15.3% to $24.75 billion. The services segment is expected to surge 75.3% to $2.44 billion and the energy generation and storage segment is anticipated to reach $1.56 billion. Total automotive revenue is expected to come in at $20.9 billion for a 12.9% gain.

Takeaway

Tesla is expected to make gains in total sales, but our estimates predict for their profitability issues to continue through the current fiscal year. The company’s recent struggles with gross profit margin should be something that investors may want to closely monitor this time around as it can indicate whether or not Tesla can reach the economies of scale it thought it could achieve by slashing the Model 3’s price.

However, Tesla has become almost synonymous with the electric vehicle, which has caused bullish investors to drive the stock higher and making Tesla a company that continues to be difficult to gauge.

41,0.9936,0.098,0.885,0.017,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) easily has the largest charging network out there with its 4,375 public charging stations and around 15,000 plugs. About a third of these enable fast charging and with upcoming new technology, it will be able to pump 75 miles (250KW) of power in about five minutes. Because Tesla mans and manages its own charging stations, which are only available to Tesla owners, this has always been a key differentiator, other than its beautiful designs.

But Ford (F - Free Report) has other plans. According to Ford spokesperson Emma Bergg, “We’re taking away all that hassle factor… That’s what we’re doing for our whole electrification plan: a seamless experience, so that jumping from internal combustion engines is not such a big deal.”

To make this a reality, the company laid out plans for its charging station network, before the 2020 launch of its first Mustang-style SUV that was from the get-go, designed to be an electric car.

And it’s not doing it alone. Electrify America will help it build the charging stations and also supply DC fast chargers. Shell Group's Greenlots will create a platform for independent charging providers to connect with buyers that Ford users can access through their FordPass apps. General Motors (GM - Free Report) , which is building a large network of public chargers with its construction partner Bechtel could even join this network later.

Ford expects this network to have more than 12,000 charging locations with more than 35,000 plugs, or more than double Tesla’s footprint. Of course, since these are independent providers, the stations will be open to all and not just Ford users.

But Ford users have an advantage in that they can go check their apps or dashboard for the closest station and make an in-app purchase rather than subscribing to the individual networks. And then, they can add 47 miles in 10 minutes, or get up to an 80% charge of their batteries in about 40 minutes. This isn’t as good as Tesla, but it’s worth noting that the market continues to evolve.

Further, since most people actually charge their batteries at home, Ford said it is working with Amazon Home Services to install at-home chargers for Ford users.

How It Affects Tesla

Since fuel is what drives vehicles and since electric cars can only go so far on a single charge, the availability of charging stations becomes very important. Tesla is ahead of the pack here, since its EVs do more than 300 miles, with the Model S doing significantly higher. No other manufacturer has that range yet, so these other cars need relatively more frequent charging.

The network approach sounds like a really good idea, especially if traditional automakers (competitors) agree to collaborate on charging stations. The number of EVs on the roads is increasing, so with easier charging available, competition is set to increase rapidly for Tesla. But it also means that it could lead to more mass-market appeal with positive kickbacks for Tesla, which is already seeing more demand than it can handle.

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the cost per gallon to charge an EV at around $1.21, less than half the cost of a gallon of gas, which is estimated to be $2.65. This can further increase EV appeal.

So is this good news or bad news for Tesla? The answer is, it’s too soon to tell.

42,0.9969,0.149,0.836,0.015,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) receives approval from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to start production at its $2-billion Gigafactory in Shanghai.

The factory would build affordable versions of Tesla Model 3 and its proposed model Y for Greater China. The company intends to produce at least 1000 Model 3 units per week in the factory as it attempts to strengthen sales in China. However, Tesla is not sure when it will be able to meet the production target for the year because of uncertainties related to orders, workers and suppliers.

The factory will be the company’s first full-scale production plant outside the United States although it has a factory in Tilburg, Netherlands, which carries out the final assembly of modules.

The recent approval can be seen as Beijing’s willingness to open up its car market. Moreover, Authorities in Shanghai have offered help to speed up construction of Tesla’s factory.

China is significant for the company’s global strategy as the government in China has set ambitious targets for electric vehicle (EV) sales.

Notably, Tesla will be the first fully foreign-owned manufacturing facility in the world’s largest auto market.

Currently, Tesla’s vehicle models imported from the United States are subject to tariffs in China. However, the introduction of the factory will help the company to avoid higher import tariffs. Moreover, China recently exempted Tesla units from a 10% vehicle purchase tax.

Rising Model 3 delivery, which forms major part of the automaker’s overall deliveries, is aiding top-line growth. Strong performance and impressive design of the company’s products are ramping up sales volumes.

Tesla is making efforts to increase vehicle deliveries. Higher volume should enable the company to achieve cost and production efficiencies. Moreover, its focus on expanding the product portfolio, introducing car-sharing services and developing self-driving capability is commendable.

Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider

43,0.9972,0.144,0.794,0.061,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

This electric car maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -104.1%.

Revenues are expected to be $6.60 billion, down 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tesla?

For Tesla, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +116.67%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that Tesla will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tesla would post a loss of $0.54 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.12, delivering a surprise of -107.41%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Tesla appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."
44,0.9886,0.103,0.83,0.067,"The auto sales slump in China, which is the world’s largest car market, refuses to die down. In more than two decades, vehicle sales slid for the first time in China in 2018 and the country’s car sales are likely to fall again this year amid macro-economic headwinds. Markedly, in September, car sales in China sank for the 15 th time in the past 16 months.

Let’s delve deeper.

China’s Auto Market Crashing: Domestic Weakness & Trade War Sting

According to data provided by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (“CAAM”), auto sales fell 5.2% year over year to 2.27 million in September. This followed year-over-year decline of 6.9% and 4.3% in August and July, respectively. Per CAAM, sales of sedans, minivans, sports utility vehicles and SUVs in the global industry’s largest market fell to 1.9 million. Waning consumer demand in the wake of tariff woes and economic slowdown is dragging down the country’s vehicle sales.

Let’s take a closer look at the latest inflation data and other economic indicators for China. The country’s economic malaise is reflected in September inflation data, which released yesterday. Notably, the country’s consumer inflation climbed to its highest levels in nearly six years amid rising pork prices. China’s factory deflation also deepened in the month, with producer price index declining 1.2% year over year, marking the third month of contraction in a row. Contracting imports, exports and industry profits are other weak spots. Meanwhile, the country’s economic slowdown has been intensified with its ongoing trade war with the United States. While a partial trade deal on Oct 11 offered a ray of hope, the trade tensions are still very much prevailing and not expected to wane anytime soon.

With the economic slowdown and U.S-Sino trade tiff, China’s auto market has been faltering like never before. Sales of new energy vehicles (“NEV”) including all-electric and plug-in hybrids declined around 34%, dropping for the third-consecutive month, due to a fall in government subsidies for purchases of such cars. Notably, NEV sales increased for 18 consecutive months till mid 2019, when it fell 4.7% and 15.7% in July and August, respectively. This is especially a matter of concern for China, which is targeting 60% of all automobiles sold in the country to run on electric motors by 2035. The ballooning EV market could burst, which is a concern for electric car makers like Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) and Nio Inc. (NIO - Free Report) .

Affected by the sluggish Chinese economy, automakers are reeling from declining demand of cars in China. Slowing economy and trade war tensions have impacted consumer sentiment, which is crucial for the sale of big-ticket discretionary items like automobiles.

China Woes Put Automakers in a Tight Spot: GM & F in Focus

Uncertainty with regard to the economic situation in China prompted people to tighten purse strings, in turn hitting U.S. auto bigwigs like General Motors (GM - Free Report) and Ford (F - Free Report) . Both General Motors and Ford carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

U.S. top automaker General Motors’ sales in China tumbled 17.5% year over year in the July-September period. In addition to weak demand and trade tiff, increasing competition also impacted the company’s sales in China. In fact, year to date, General Motors’ sales in China have fallen 15.8%, with the company reporting negative sales growth for five consecutive quarters. In a bid to restore sales, the company has targeted to launch 20 new and refreshed models in China this year.

General Motors’ rival, Ford’s sales in China also took a hit, declining 30.3% year over year in the third quarter of 2019. Notably, Ford’s sales in the country have been on a decline since 2007. A weak auto market and trade-war politics continued to worsen Ford’s ongoing slump in China. To revive its position in the country, the firm plans to launch more than 30 new models through 2021.

More Bumps Ahead?

While some industry watchdogs are of the opinion that the slump in China’s auto market is likely to bottom out soon, there are no signs of a turnaround yet. With every new data coming out of the country pointing to a slowdown in the economy, there is not much optimism. In fact, per Reuters, China’s auto sales could witness negative to low growth over the next three years amid low consumer confidence and trade tiff with the United States. The 19-month old trade tussle between the United States and China is yet to reach a conclusion.

In addition to a weak economic outlook, tighter terms for vehicle financing and increasing popularity of ride-sharing platforms are also likely to weigh on car sales. With the auto sector’s output being a key component in China’s GDP, the government is likely to provide support in the event of a prolonged downcycle. In fact, the slowdown did prompt the Chinese authorities to take measures for boosting auto sales in order to kickstart the sputtering economy. For instance, China’s State Council asked the local governments to gradually relax restrictions on auto sales, support the purchase of NEVs and expand the second-hand car market in the country to prop up the auto market. The efforts have not yielded the required results yet and carmakers are waiting with bated breath to witness a rebound in China’s auto market.

While China still needs to rev up stimulus measures for boosting sales, improvement in the economy and consumer spending, along with the U.S.-Sino trade truce will be crucial for the auto sector to recover from the slump. Automakers will have to be prepared for a prolonged period of weakness and resort to cost containment and other strategies to overcome the resultant challenges.

45,0.9966,0.143,0.819,0.038,"It was a fairly ""meh"" Monday on the stock market -- which, perhaps in some ways, is a relief given the recent seesaw volatility we've witnessed.

As ever, though, some top stocks bucked the overall trend with some nice price leaps, while others fell to earth. Since it's always nice to begin the week on a note of optimism, here's a look at two companies in the former camp.

Tesla

An up-and-down stock if ever there was one, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) accelerated today to close nearly 4% higher.

There's no clear, immediate reason for the stock to enjoy such a bump... but then again, reason doesn't always apply to Tesla. Like Apple in certain ways, the company has a core of fans who love its business and aesthetics, and admire the -- shall we say -- frequently unorthodox approaches CEO Elon Musk employs to manage its operations.

These bulls aren't entirely off base, looking at recent events. No, the company didn't hit its ambition of delivering 100,000 cars in its Q3, and at a tally of just over 96,000, it fell short of analyst estimates, too (although it was a quarterly record for the company).

Nevertheless, 96,000-plus is an impressive number for a maverick niche manufacturer in a tough, capital-intensive industry that doesn't come close to the scale of a General Motors or Ford. Those two giants, by the by, are still to some extent playing catch-up to Tesla in the electric vehicle (EV) space.

This summer Tesla also announced a modest price cut to its best-selling Model 3, in the hopes of juicing sales.

Investors who bid up Tesla today might also be counting on better-than-expected results when the company reports its official Q3 numbers next week. Analyst estimates are, unsurprisingly, all over the place -- according to Yahoo! Finance they range from a solid per-share net profit of $0.34 to a red-soaked $3.52 loss.

Given the chronically high expenses and cash issues saddling the company, I'd bet on a shortfall, but this company always has the capacity to surprise us. That said, I'm still wary of Tesla, as I think it has many challenges it hasn't fully proven it can surmount.

Shopify

A recent addition to the up-and-down stock club is software-as-a-service (SaaS) purveyor Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). Adding to recent gains following a dip, the company's stock rose by almost 5% today.

Is this justified? I think so. Shopify is a facilitator of e-commerce services, so if, for example, I start a business called Eric's Not Overly Tasty Lemonade, I can use the company's digital tools to sell my semi-quality beverage online.

No one who has turned on a PC or mobile device in the past few years has to be told that the e-commerce space is growing exponentially. Shopify is also on the rise, with a nearly 50% year-over-year increase in revenue in its most recently reported quarter.

This is the kind of sector and company-specific growth investors look for, so it's no wonder that Shopify is experiencing yet another spurt of popularity. Of course, there's competition in the form of monoliths like Amazon.com, but Shopify seems to be doing a good job competing on quality and value.

The company will surely continue to ride the ever-cresting e-commerce wave. Meanwhile, Shopify's $450 million deal last month to acquire robotic warehouse equipment specialist 6 River Systems indicates it's got a sharp eye on future growth opportunities in complementary segments.

As is typical for a young(ish) tech company, Shopify is unprofitable. Yet those losses are not necessarily all that scary, and the company is in the right place at the right time with the right products. It feels very much like a buy to me, even with the latest share price rise."
46,0.9997,0.156,0.798,0.046,"Ford Motor (NYSE:F) versus Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)? The Dearborn dinosaur versus Elon Musk's futuristic dream? Seriously?

Yes, seriously. For starters, both stocks are down sharply from highs earlier in the decade. And while the two companies are different, both are facing similar challenges as investors start to confront the possibility of a recession sometime in the next couple of years.

So which is the better buy now? It's not as simple as you might think. Read on.

Valuation and stock performance

If you haven't been following the two companies closely, you might be surprised to learn that Ford's stock has outperformed Tesla's since the beginning of 2019 -- but both have trailed the S&P 500 Index 's (SNPINDEX:^SPX) year-to-date gain.

Ford's stock has risen in 2019, but it's still cheap by historical measures. Right now, Ford's shares are trading at around 6.5 times its adjusted earnings over the past four quarters. The historical norm for a healthy automaker is around 10 times earnings, at least in periods when sales are strong (as they are now, for the most part).

It's not fair to value Tesla using traditional earnings-based metrics, as the company has yet to reach sustainable profitability. An alternative is to look at Tesla's enterprise value, a metric that aims to capture a theoretical acquisition price by adding the value of a company's debt to its market cap. For most established automakers, the enterprise-value-to-revenue ratio is right around 1. (Ford's is about 1.05 at the moment). Tesla's is about 2.16 -- about double its larger peers'.

At least by these metrics, Ford's stock looks cheap and Tesla's looks expensive. But again, it's not that simple. Let's dig deeper.

Tesla's valuation is all about its story

Tesla's valuation isn't driven by its current financial performance; it's driven by investors' expectations of future growth -- a story, in other words. As the story goes, Tesla's sales will continue to rise sharply over the next several years as the developed world embraces electric vehicles, until it's one of the world's largest and most profitable automakers.

While the company's shares have sagged over the past year, many Wall Street analysts are still bullish about Tesla's near-term growth potential. While analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tesla to post a loss of $3.47 per share in 2019, they expect a profit of $4.02 per share, on average, in 2020 -- and more growth for several years thereafter.

Here are the high points of the bull case for Tesla, in a nutshell:

Tesla's factory in Shanghai, currently under construction, will begin cranking out Model 3s for the local market within months.
Tesla's long-awaited compact crossover SUV, the Model-3-based Model Y, is expected to launch next year and to sell in big numbers.
Tesla will soon show an electric pickup truck with the potential to challenge the Detroit stalwarts.
Overall demand for Teslas will remain strong, exceeding Tesla's production capacity, helping it to get strong prices and margins for its current and upcoming models.

Of course, there's a bearish view too:

Demand for Teslas may be peaking. Many early adopters have already bought, and Tesla has yet to see significant demand from mainstream car-buyers. Tesla's third-quarter deliveries were up just 2% sequentially, giving this argument some weight.
To the extent that Tesla's sales are growing, the lower-profit Model 3 is cannibalizing sales of Tesla's larger and more profitable Model S and Model X. Sales of both of the larger Teslas fell in the third quarter.
Tesla's U.S. factory doesn't have room to build an additional high-volume product, meaning that the company will have to make some big investments before the pickup -- or anything else -- comes to market. That isn't happening -- in fact, the company has reduced its capital spending amid hefty losses.
Tesla could soon face another cash crunch. While it had $5 billion on hand as of the end of the second quarter, it also lost $408 million during the period -- while spending just $250 million on capex. If it can't figure out how to generate more cash from operations to fund its ambitious growth plans, they might not happen as soon as investors would like -- or at all.

The bear-case points have been drivers of Tesla's share-price decline in 2019. But Tesla's stock is still very expensive -- unless you believe that big near-term sales and earnings growth is still in the cards.

Ford's valuation is a different story

Why did Ford's stock do so well earlier in the decade -- and why has it slipped since?

Ford came out of the 2009 recession hitting on all cylinders. By mid-decade, it was generating strong margins on trucks and SUVs in North America, and it seemed to be in good shape in Europe and on a promising growth trajectory in China.

But things haven't gone so well since:

While Ford's revenue kept growing, thanks to strong pricing on its trucks and SUVs, its costs also grew, limiting its margin gains -- and eventually reversing them.
The wheels fell off of Ford's China growth story. Ford was slow to update its product lineup and didn't tailor enough of its products to Chinese tastes. Its promising growth turned into declines, and its profits to losses.
As investors grew more excited about electric vehicles and self-driving -- not least because of Tesla's success -- Ford seemed to be falling behind on both fronts.

All of these concerns, and more, were exacerbated in the months after CEO Jim Hackett took the helm in 2017. Hackett talked in general terms about a ""redesign"" of Ford's business, while supplying few specifics. That was a big change from past Ford leadership teams, which tended to share their plans openly with investors -- leading analysts to wonder if Hackett actually had a plan.

Ford did eventually explain what it had in mind: directing its investments away from lower-margin products (like sedans) and businesses, and toward more profitable products (trucks, SUVs, commercial vehicles, and performance models) and businesses, including new tech-enabled mobility ventures. That evolution is ongoing:

Ford has discontinued the Fiesta, Focus, and Taurus in North America, and will phase out the Fusion over the next couple of years. It has launched all-new versions of the Ranger and Explorer, is in the process of launching an all-new Escape, and it has several other new trucks, SUV, and crossovers set to arrive over the next couple of years -- including an all-new F-150 in 2020.
In Europe, Ford has pushed upscale with an all-new Focus, added a new small SUV called the Puma, and put heavy emphasis on its profitable commercial vehicle business. Progress is already visible: After a big loss in 2018, Ford Europe earned $110 million in the first half of 2019.
A drastic overhaul of Ford's China operation is under way, with over 30 new or overhauled products set to arrive by the end of 2021. There's still much work to be done, but Ford's losses in China were down sharply in the first half of 2019.
Ford is also making heavy investments in electric vehicles -- including an electric F-150 pickup -- and self-driving technology, which have helped to allay some investors' concerns about technological disruption.

Although some progress is already visible, Ford has said that its product-line overhaul will begin to have a meaningful impact on its margins by the end of next year. The company's goal is a sustainable operating margin above 8%, with revenue growth exceeding the rate of growth of global gross domestic product.

When will that happen? The answer depends to some extent on economic factors, but if auto sales remain strong, we should see significant progress within two years.

Ford's dividend is an important consideration

Tesla doesn't pay a dividend, and it's not likely to start anytime in the near future. But Ford pays a dividend, and it's an important part of the company's investment case.

Ford has paid a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share since 2015. It also paid a supplemental dividend early in the year in 2016, 2017, and 2018, after posting strong full-year profits.

Ford chose to keep its regular quarterly dividend unchanged, and it's important to understand why. Ford considers its current dividend to be set at a level that it can sustain ""through the cycle,"" meaning through a recession when its profits will come under pressure.

Put another way, Ford wants to show investors that they can count on its dividend -- so it won't cut the dividend unless things get truly dire. The company believes that between the steady income from its financing subsidiary and its hefty cash hoard ($23.2 billion as of June 30), it will be able to fund its dividend through a downturn without difficulty. And it believes that once it does, Wall Street will give its stock a higher valuation.

Is Tesla or Ford the better buy now?

Whether Tesla or Ford is the better buy depends on your investment horizon, your risk tolerance, and your faith in Elon Musk. But keep in mind that auto sales are cyclical, automakers' profits and margins tend to rise and fall with sales, the current cycle is quite old by historical standards -- and all of that applies even to innovative high-tech automakers.

If you buy Tesla now, you might double your money or more over the next five years or so. But if Tesla's valuation falls to something more like a normal automaker's, as it very well might during a recession, you could lose a substantial chunk of your investment -- or even all of it, if Tesla runs out of cash and has to take a trip through bankruptcy court. (That's a real possibility, by the way.)

On the other hand, I think if you buy Ford now, reinvest that dividend, and wait five years or so, you stand a good chance of outperforming the market as Hackett's redesign unfolds and Ford's profitability improves. If there's a recession during that period, Ford should weather it without trouble -- and its stock could well jump early in the recovery, as it did coming out of the last recession.

To sum up: Tesla's story is still great, even if it's slowly coming down to earth. It's still possible that its shares could soar. But its finances are much less great, and a downturn could put a big dent in its valuation.

Ford's story isn't nearly as exciting, but the Blue Oval is well positioned for realistic earnings growth over the next several years. If you can afford to be patient and reinvest the dividend, I think it's the better buy for most investors right now."
47,0.9898,0.07,0.886,0.044,"In 2019, investors both bullish and bearish on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock have had fuel to back up their views. Bulls like the fact that the company has ramped up deliveries significantly and introduced a low-priced standard-range Model 3, while revenue has soared as net losses shrank and cash flow improved.

Bears, however, will point to a number of downsides, including Tesla's lack of profitability and its cash burn, which spurred Tesla to actually raise money in May and dilute shareholder value. In addition, the company has executed several rounds of layoffs this year, then announced it was shuttering its showrooms in an effort to save costs, only to reverse course days later, deciding to keep many showrooms open.

The biggest fear around Tesla, however, is that there isn't enough demand for its electric vehicles. That would essentially torpedo much of the bull case, as Tesla is investing heavily in expanding production for its Model 3 and its upcoming Model Y crossover to begin mass production in late 2020. Tesla has promised that it will cause a sea change in buying behavior for EVs, disrupting the auto industry, so if demand isn't actually there, Tesla has a problem.

On that front, bears have pointed to this year's price cuts across all Tesla models as evidence that people don't want its cars. In its recent second-quarter earnings report, Tesla showed quarterly declines in average selling prices for the Model 3 as well as the Model S and Model X vehicles. Tesla subsequently dropped prices again for the Model 3 in July, along with even more pricing adjustments to both the S and X.

But before investors press the sell button on Tesla shares, there are a few details to know about these cuts, and why they might not be so scary.

Model 3 cuts were part of the plan

Make no mistake: Tesla's future will hinge on mass-market adoption of the Model 3, along with the upcoming Model Y. In the second quarter, the average selling price (ASP) on Tesla's Model 3 declined slightly from the prior quarter. In addition, after the quarter ended, the company announced it would be cutting the price of the low-end Model 3 again, by an additional $1,000, with even greater cuts for the higher-priced models with more features.

But there are a few perfectly valid reasons for these cuts. The first ""price cut,"" in the first half of 2019, wasn't so much a price cut as it was the introduction of the company's lowest-cost standard-range Model 3, which retailed starting at $35,000. Prior to February, the company had only been selling the long-range versions of the Model 3, which were priced from about $50,000 to $60,000. Obviously, since the lower-priced standard-range Model 3 was introduced midway through the first quarter, the overall ASP for the Model 3 was likely to come down in the second quarter, when Tesla had experienced a full quarter of selling the lower-priced vehicle.

Encouragingly, the ASP on overall Model 3 sales was almost even from Q1 to Q2, because buyers are still mostly opting for the longer-range versions of the Model 3. Another positive sign: Tesla is getting a higher gross margin, even on a flat average selling price, as it continues to control costs and leverage its fixed-cost base on higher volume.

Things changed again after July 1, however, with the phasing out of the federal tax credit for buying an electric vehicle. So this roughly $2,000 ""discount"" would no longer be available. In response, Tesla did a rather intelligent thing. It lowered the price of the standard-range Model 3 by $1,000, essentially splitting the difference of the price increase with the customer. That makes the Model 3 more enticing than it otherwise would be, while also not alienating customers who bought the Model 3 prior to the tax credit's expiration.

However, buyers of the longer-range vehicles may not be as happy. After the tax credit expired, Tesla dropped its price of the longer-range Model 3s and those with more features by $2,000 and $5,000, respectively. While that may leave a sour taste in the mouth of anyone who bought the deluxe Model 3 before the price cut, bringing down the price of the highest-priced Model 3 is likely to entice more customers to upgrade to the higher-priced option. That should help boost Tesla's margins as it produces more and more vehicles.

Model X and S cuts also misleading

Tesla's higher-priced Model S and Model X vehicles also had lower ASPs in the second quarter. While that's not necessarily a great sign, Tesla seems to be going for a strategy of making premium features standard on the S and X models.

In April, the company upgraded the drivetrain and suspension in the Model S and X, and also implemented a new active adaptive dampening feature, along with other software upgrades. Tesla then discounted some older inventory that had been produced prior to the introduction of the new features. This happens all the time in both the technology and auto sectors, when older-year models are discounted after a newer model or improvements are introduced. Tesla doesn't improve the cars on an annual schedule like the rest of the car industry, and these upgrades just happened to fall in Q2.

In addition to the upgraded features, Tesla actually decided to discontinue its standard-range version of the S and the X, in an effort to streamline the portfolio and lower its cost structure. However, Tesla is also cutting the prices on these higher-end, long-range S and X models, yet still leaving their prices higher than the now-discontinued standard versions. This, again, seems like a strategy to lure customers into trading up, which they might be more inclined to do, since they are already opting for the more expensive S or X models.

The cost of the ""performance"" version of the S is now down from $96,000 to $92,115. Meanwhile, the price of the middle-range version of the X has been cut from $91,000 to $84,990, though the ""performance"" version of the X is actually increasing from $102,000 to $104,990. Yet all models are still priced higher than the now-discontinued standard models.

In addition, the volume of the S and X models combined is only about 4%-5% the volume of the expected demand for the combined Model 3 and Model Y, according to Elon Musk. This is not to say that the S and X don't matter, but worrying about a few points of selling price or volume in any quarter isn't entirely relevant to the Tesla thesis. Regardless, cutting out the standard version of these high-end models is likely to streamline Tesla's cost structure. Tesla is likely pivoting to a margin strategy on the X and S now that the 3 and Y models will be ramping at much higher volumes.

Following the tech curve

Tesla's price adjustments may have the effect of rattling shareholders and feeding skeptics, but they do seem rather practical when taken together. Keep in mind, the lowest-priced Model 3 just saw a price increase due to the tax credit expiration, while higher-priced (and higher-margin) products saw prices come down. Tesla appears to be luring customers to opt for ""high-grading"" their cars as production reaches greater volumes.

Still in massive expansion mode, Tesla needs to drive volume and efficiency in order to get the economies of scale it needs. To that end, Tesla is taking more of the technological route to production, not unlike companies in the semiconductor industry. As processes become more efficient, prices come down, which spurs more demand, which then enables greater efficiency in production, which enable lower prices, in a virtuous circle.

Eventually, Tesla and its shareholders hope that the lowest-priced Model 3 and Y versions will persuade customers to opt for Teslas over gas-powered cars. But with the lowest-priced Model 3 still $10,000 to $15,000 more expensive than gas-powered sedans like the Civic or Corolla, even the Model 3 may still be too pricey for a large swath of the population. So don't be surprised if Tesla continues to lower prices as it increases volume. It may not work perfectly, but making its cars more and more affordable over time is all part of Tesla's grand plan."
48,0.9865,0.083,0.889,0.028,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is at it again, with another impressive rally following a devastating share price breakdown at the beginning of the year. The initial decline was caused by liquidity concerns and disappointing delivery numbers, starting in mid-December of last year and lasted until the beginning of June. The share price ripped down over 50%. The price has since rallied 40% since June 3 rd, with cash no longer being a concern and deliveries looking strong.

TSLA is historically one of the most volatile stock on the market with huge swings like the one we saw this year being a norm Elon Musk’s overzealous claims, strong investor opinions combined with big surprises (good and bad) make a potent mix for volatility.

The most recent rally, which began this summer, was initially a bounce back from the liquidity concerns, which were alleviated with a capital infusion along with a record number of vehicle deliveries in Q2 (95,200 cars). Tesla was able to raise almost $3 billion in an equity and bond offering in early May.

TSLA had fallen to the lowest levels the stock had seen in over 3 years, and the reversal was sharp, as short-sellers exited positions and savvy investors saw this as an undervalued equity. Following the robust vehicle delivery figures in June, the share price surged further. The stock rallied almost 50% in a month and a half after its low into earnings. TSLA missed big on its Q2 earnings, which led to another stock break down.

This breakdown only lasted a month, and we are now back up to the $250 level, which this stock has historically bounced off. This $250 level is represented below in a 3-year chart by the red line. Investors can’t stay away from TSLA when they see a price they like. This stock is also prone to trend trading (until it’s not), meaning that it has big run-ups and run-downs.

TSLA’s October rally is due to its record-breaking delivery figures. The EV firm delivered an astounding 97,000 cars in the 3 rd quarter. Elon’s over-ambitious delivery forecast of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries may still be attainable if the company can deliver 105,000 in the 4 th quarter.

This boost in investor sentiment could be a good trend trade into earnings, which is expected after the bell on Wednesday, October 23 rd.

Shanghai Gigafactory

Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, China, is going to change the game for the electric vehicle maker. US automakers are going to be subject to a 50% import tax. Tesla’s new domestic Gigafactory will shield it from this tax and give the company direct access to the largest electric vehicle market in the world.

This new factory is expected to start production this quarter and looks to be on schedule, something that is rare for Tesla. This company is anticipating to make 250,000 cars per year in Phase 1 and eventually reach its capacity of 500,000 vehicles produced annually.

If the project can be completed with no hiccups, this will solidify the firm as a global EV leader. China buys more than double the number of electric cars of any other single country, and Tesla’s direct access to this market should proliferate its sales.

Take Away

Currently, electric vehicles make up less than 1% of global passenger cars, and by 2030 this figure is expected to be closer to 15%, according to IEA. The market for electric vehicles is proven, and Tesla not only is the market leader, but it produces the highest-quality vehicles. Its economy class vehicle makes it affordable for a huge portion of the market.

Tesla is positioned to take over the automotive industry entirely as the world move to EVs. The archaic big 3 (Ford (F - Free Report) , GM (GM - Free Report) , Fiat Chrysler (FCAU - Free Report) will not be able to keep up the accelerating innovations and economies to scale that Tesla has already achieved.

In September, the company delivered 3,459 vehicles, which included 2,864 Model 3s. As a result, Tesla’s market share in the U.K. rose to 2.2%.

In the third quarter, the company delivered 6,244 vehicles, which included 5,385 Model 3s. It delivered more vehicles in the third quarter than it did in all of 2018. Last year, it delivered 3,372 vehicles in the U.K.

Tesla’s Model 3 has been one of the bestselling cars in the Netherlands and Norway. In September, it outpaced the sale of internal combustion engine cars in Norway. In Italy, it was the best-selling electric vehicle (EV) in September. Notably, 325 Model 3 units were sold in September, which accounted for 26% of Italy EV sales.

The sale of Tesla’s Model 3 is increasing with each passing month. If it continues, it can help the company achieve its target of 360,000-400,000 deliveries in 2019. Tesla delivered a record 97,000 electric vehicles in the third quarter. However, to achieve the lower end of its guidance, the company needs to deliver at least 104,781 units in the fourth quarter.

50,0.9849,0.111,0.811,0.078,"The young and flamboyant face of Tesla has dulled lately. The northward movement of its growth has been obstructed by both external and internal factors. The nagging U.S.-China trade war and rising tariffs are hampering Tesla’s profits from international markets. What’s more, the frequent controversial tweets by its CEO have made Tesla’ share price volatile.

Will it now be possible for the magnificent electronic car maker to reap profits given that its peers are catching up fast?

Impact of U.S.-Sino Trade War

The electric car maker has captured a sweet spot in the Chinese market. In fact, China is the biggest international market for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) . In the second quarter of 2019, Tesla recorded $1.5 billion in sales from China. With strong sales of its Model 3, Model X and Model S in the third quarter, the Chinese government has granted a 10% purchase tax reduction to the company, exclusively.

As a result of the trade war, China has imposed 25% tariffs on U.S. auto imports from Dec 15 which would increase the cost for Tesla. But with the 10% discount, Tesla can avoid concerns of a price rise. However, two things will constantly bother Tesla in this respect.

The electric car maker will have to be diligent enough to stoke up consumer demand to beat competitors. But most importantly, it must prepare itself for worse. If 25% tariffs are imposed with the existing duties on auto imports, imported autos in China will cost 50% more after Dec 15. Now, the fate of Tesla depends on the U.S.-China high-level talks. If the trade war escalates, the company will be exposed to tariffs and the Chinese government can easily retract the purchase tax reduction.

In the present scenario, Tesla is already highly priced in China and any tariff-induced rise could hurt its sales. However, Tesla is working hard on running its Shanghai-based manufacturing plant as soon as possible.

Tesla, Musk and Controversies

Coming to controversies, both Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk are in the spotlight. Last year, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX landed in controversies with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

In August 2018, Musk’s tweet “am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured” dragged Tesla to court. Later, per a court judgment, Musk agreed to submit public statements about Tesla’s finances vetted by its legal counsel. The deal with the SEC also included a damaging cost and Musk had to step down from the position of Tesla’s chairman.

Further, in September last year, Tesla had claimed its cars to be the “safest” and said that its Model S has a 5.4-star rating. As per NHTSA, the car did get five star rating in all categories but cannot be claimed as the safest car and Tesla has been misleading its customer.

Another comment made by Musk in 2018 recently haunted him. Musk, in a tweet, had called Vernon Unsworth, a diver who rescued young soccer players stuck in Thailand’s underwater cave a “pedo guy” and referred to him as a “child rapist.” There was a rift between them since Unsworth criticized Musk’s rescue plan with a submarine. In September 2018, Unsworth sued for defamation and the tussle is going on.

These distorted information and tweets by Tesla’s CEO had led to huge volatility in the stock price. Neither the tweet on privatizing the company nor safety-related comments could be ignored.

Tesla has been growing for a long time in spite of critics calling it as a money-losing venture. Though it has provided good returns to bears and short-sellers, Tesla has not posted profits in the last few years. In fact, the company’s shares have declined 26.5% on a year-to-date basis in contrast the S&P 500’s rise of 17.2%.

Tesla’s controversies are shifting attention away from its fundamentals. The company has gained a lot of attention in the overseas market and dominates the electric vehicle market. In fact, other established automakers like Ford Motor Company (F - Free Report) , General Motors Company (GM - Free Report) , NIO Inc. (NIO - Free Report) and Volkswagen AG (VWAGY - Free Report) are closing following it and catching up pace in electrifying their vehicles.

Volvo’s Polestar 2 model is lately giving tough competition to Tesla’s Model 3 by following some of Tesla’s strategies. However, Tesla’s software and battery capabilities give it an edge over its competitors. Unfortunately, Tesla’s frequent controversies are distracting and disrupting its image.

51,-0.4479,0.113,0.773,0.114,"Electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has seen impressive growth in vehicle sales recently. Trailing-12-month deliveries are up 88%, fueled by surging production and deliveries of its lower-cost Model 3. But questions remain about how viable the company's business is as the automaker scales. While its losses have been narrowing and its free cash flow has turned positive, there's still uncertainty about whether this momentum can continue.

Questions linger: With Tesla's growth driven entirely by its lowest-priced vehicle, could the automaker's gross profit margin contract and weigh on profitability? Will spending on more production capacity and new vehicle development hurt free cash flow?

The company's third quarter will provide a timely window into whether or not Tesla's business is showing signs of scalability. When the automaker reports its third-quarter results on Oct. 23, here are two key areas investors will want to look at in order to assess Tesla's business.

Automotive gross margin

One of the key bull cases for Tesla stock is that the company will eventually be able to flex its premium brand and consistently command a 25% gross profit margin on its automotive business. Indeed, the company has said it is targeting a non-GAAP (adjusted) gross profit margin of 25% for combined sales of its Model S, Model X, and Model 3. This target is impressive because it's about the same gross profit margin that Tesla had on its higher-priced Model S and X sales before Model 3 production and deliveries ramped up. Achieving and sustaining this target even as Model 3 deliveries grow to account for a larger portion of total sales, therefore, would imply that Model 3 production is seeing improved efficiency.

Unfortunately, this key metric has been moving in the wrong direction recently, suggesting Tesla is having trouble achieving the economies of scale it believed it could. After its automotive gross margin peaked in the third quarter of 2018 at 25.8%, it decreased to 24.3% in Q4, 20.2% in Q1, and 18.9% in Q2. This means that Tesla's gross margin is moving in the wrong direction as Model 3 deliveries increase.

For this reason, investors should tune in closely to this metric when the automaker reports its third-quarter results. Tesla already announced it delivered a record 97,000 vehicles during the quarter, with nearly 80,000 of these vehicles being Model 3 -- more than any other quarter. Were these increased Model 3 deliveries during the period enough for economies of scale to start materializing, or did the company's automotive gross margin contract once again?

Net income

If Tesla's automotive gross profit margin moves in the wrong direction, the automaker may have trouble meeting its guidance. At the time of the company's second-quarter update, management guided to be profitable in Q3. But the Street seems to have doubts about this target. On average, analysts expect Tesla to report a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.42 in Q3.

If Model 3 gross margin did hit a tipping point of improved efficiency during the quarter, Tesla could surprise investors and report a profit. But given the company's history of losses, there are no guarantees."
52,0.9844,0.08,0.903,0.017,"Between the ongoing U.S-China trade war, concerns of a broader economic slowdown, and geopolitical strife in general, it seems an understatement to say many investors are hesitant to buy stocks with any kind of outsized reliance on China.

But for those willing to play a contrarian role, now might be the perfect time to do exactly that. To this end, here are three China stocks I think investors could do well to consider buying today.

The ""Disney of China""

Considering it recently exceeded 100 million paying subscribers for its fast-growing video-streaming service -- good for growth of 50% year over year -- it's no surprise iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) is often called the "" Netflix of China"" by investors. But even putting aside iQiyi's enormous advertising business, which fellow Fool Simon Erickson recently noted still funds the entirety of its research, sales, and marketing expenses, iQiyi management has insisted its longer-term business model will look similar to that of an online version of Disney, with plans to build out a comprehensive ecosystem of entertainment content and IP, including literature, comics, novels, and online games.

At the same time, investors need to recognize that iQiyi must walk a fine line in creating content that appeases China's often-strict regulators. And the stock is undoubtedly sensitive to any macroeconomic forces that threaten to slow the growth (and disposable income) of China's rising middle class.

But as the company continues to build its membership base and enterprise value -- and with the stock currently trading around 13% below its $18-per-share IPO price from early 2018 -- I think investors who can entertain the idea of iQiyi significantly expanding its reach in the coming years would do well to consider opening or adding to a position now.

The ""Amazon of China""

By contrast, shares of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) have rallied more than 30% so far in 2019. Most recently, that rise was aided by a big post-earnings pop last month after the Chinese e-commerce leader (and so-called Amazon of China) swung to GAAP profitability and absolutely trounced its own guidance for revenue (up 18% to $21.9 billion) in the second quarter.

Much like Amazon here in the U.S. -- and unlike marketplace sites like eBay stateside and its Chinese peer Alibaba -- JD's edge comes from its status as China's largest direct e-commerce retailer, which stems from its conscious decision to hold its own inventory and invest heavily in its own delivery and logistics network. That strategy has meant slim profits for JD to date as it works to scale its business in the near term. But over the longer term, that scale should begin to more rapidly translate to steady market-share gains and -- as Chinese consumers continue to shift their buying to online sources -- enviable operating leverage with fatter margins.

As it stands, I think we're still in the earliest stages of JD's long-term growth story. As the benefits of its investments begin to yield more tangible fruit, I think its recent gains will prove to be only the start of a longer-term trend of consistently beating the market.

The future of electric vehicles

Finally, I'm well aware Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) isn't a pure play on China, particularly considering the electric vehicle (EV) maker collected only 8% of its $22.8 billion in 2018 revenue from the Middle Kingdom.

But for perspective, when Tesla announced second-quarter results in late July, CEO Elon Musk said the company was on track to start Model 3 production by the end of 2019. Coincidentally -- exactly nine months since Tesla broke ground on its Shanghai Gigafactory in January -- on Monday industry watchers spotted what appeared to be the first made-in-China Tesla Model 3 driving on the facility's test track.

Assuming all goes as planned, Tesla's new Shanghai factory will boast an initial manufacturing capacity of 150,000 units per year, proving instrumental in not only reducing the cost of catering to China's massive auto industry, but also ramping toward the company's 2020 production target for 500,000 vehicles globally.

There are other moving parts involved in owning a piece of Tesla, of course, whether we're talking about headwinds created by its record (but still apparently underwhelming) Q3 deliveries, scrutiny surrounding Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity, or the market's reaction to the widely anticipated unveiling of Tesla's electric pickup truck in the coming weeks.

But I still think there are enough positive catalysts for Tesla to make my short list of top China stocks to buy now, if even in the form of a small starter position to keep tabs on its progress."
53,0.9974,0.105,0.853,0.042,"Few auto stocks have ever excited investors like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The innovative electric-car maker and its CEO, Elon Musk, have won legions of fans and plenty of customers with groundbreaking -- if not always perfect -- upscale battery-powered vehicles.

Taking a page from Tesla's book, Chinese start-up NIO (NYSE:NIO) emerged last year with a handsome upscale electric SUV and big plans for more. Investors hoping to make money from electric-vehicle sales in China flocked to NIO's shares -- at least for a while.

But for both companies, the stories have shifted in the last year, and not in good ways. Shares of both Tesla and NIO have declined since the beginning of 2019. With concerns about auto sales rising around the world, it's time to ask: Is either of these companies a good buy for new money now?

Valuation and stock performance

Neither company's stock has had a good year, but Tesla's year hasn't been nearly as bad as NIO's:

When it comes to valuations, traditional metrics don't really apply to either company. They're both what we call ""story stocks,"" companies with valuations driven by expectations of future growth and profitability.

Those expectations are in turn driven by the stories -- the future possibilities that we might see for these businesses, not the current businesses themselves. For example: A fundamental-minded investor might look at Tesla and see a money-losing automaker that continues to struggle with quality and service issues. That company probably isn't worth much, relatively speaking.

But if we believe (for example) that Tesla is poised to become one of the world's largest-selling and most-profitable automakers by 2025 or so, then we could argue that its valuation should be driven by those expectations and not by the current reality.

It's the expectations that have given Tesla a $44 billion market cap, not the current reality. And Tesla's share price -- and NIO's -- have risen and fallen as those expectations have shifted over time.

What's the state of Tesla's story now?

Right now, Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tesla to lose $3.47 per share in 2019, on average, on revenue of $24.7 billion. But they expect things to turn around in 2020, when they believe Tesla will report $4.02 per share in profit on revenue of $30.3 billion.

In a nutshell, the story that is driving those expectations goes something like this:

Tesla is nearing completion of a second assembly plant, near Shanghai, that will begin building Model 3 cars for the Chinese market soon (possibly before the end of 2019).
Tesla will begin building its next model, the Model Y crossover SUV based on the Model 3, in the U.S. next year.
A pickup truck that will present a serious challenge to Ford Motor Company 's (NYSE:F) F-150 and other Detroit stalwarts is also coming soon.
Demand for Teslas will continue to be very strong, exceeding Tesla's production capacity, and Tesla will be able to get good pricing for its current and upcoming models.

Of course, that story has developed some cracks:

Tesla's third-quarter deliveries were up just 2% over its second-quarter total, calling its growth story into question. When the market for new cars enters a cyclical slump, which it will at some point, those questions will get louder.
The lower-priced (and lower-profit-margin) Model 3 appears to be cannibalizing sales of Tesla's more profitable Model S and Model X, which fell in the third quarter.
At the moment, Tesla doesn't have the factory capacity to build a pickup truck in volume, and it will take time and a lot of cash to create that capacity.

As I see it, all of the questions about Tesla's story boil down to these two:

Can the company continue to increase sales sequentially as economic seas get choppier?
Will it need to raise yet more cash in order to keep going?

I suspect the answers to those questions are ""no"" and ""yes,"" respectively. If I'm right, then Tesla's stock is unlikely to beat the market over the next few years. If not -- specifically, if it can maintain sales growth for a while longer -- then its stock might still outperform.

What about NIO?

NIO's story is a little simpler. Sales of its first mass-produced product, the 7-passenger ES8 SUV, were good in the first months after its launch in June of 2018. NIO followed up the ES8 with a smaller upscale electric crossover called the ES6, which compared well with Tesla's Model 3 on paper -- and sales of that model have been decent since its launch a few months ago.

But NIO has spent a lot of money getting this far, quite a bit more than it should have. Now, it's in a cash crunch: The company had just $503.4 million in cash remaining as of June 30, after having burned about $620 million in the second quarter as it geared up to launch the ES6.

NIO did announce a deal to raise $200 million in September, and its third-quarter sales were good, but that's probably not enough. A key analyst thinks the company will run out of cash before the end of the year unless it's bailed out by a big investor or the Chinese government. CEO William Li said in September that the company was working on a new financing package, but as of this writing no details have surfaced.

Right now, NIO's shares are probably best thought of as an option on the possibility that it will manage to survive without a trip through China's equivalent of bankruptcy court.

So which is the better buy?

Here's the thing: Autos are a cyclical business. Auto sales rise and fall with consumer confidence, and automakers' profits rise and fall with sales. Because automakers -- even innovative electric-vehicle makers like Tesla and NIO -- have such high fixed costs, a moderate decline in sales can be enough to entirely erase even a financially strong automaker's profits. And given the age of the current cycle, a significant decline seems likely in the not-too-distant future.

Given that neither of these companies is sustainably profitable now, it's hard to make a case for either under the circumstances. If you believe in Tesla's longer-term growth story, and think that it's likely to muddle through whatever economic storms lie ahead without a trip through bankruptcy court, then it might not be a terrible buy at current prices. But if sales start to slip, you might be able to buy it for much less in a few quarters.

As for NIO, at this moment it feels like a long shot. I suggest avoiding NIO stock, at least until the company's near-term financial fate is clear."
54,-0.8081,0.083,0.813,0.104,"How to invest in penny stocks (if you're dead set on doing it)

If we can't persuade you not to invest in penny stocks, you should at least use some precautions to protect yourself.

1. Set a maximum investment that you're willing to lose

First, figure out how much money you can afford to lose and then limit yourself to investing that amount. That way, if your investment goes under -- as many investments in penny stocks do -- you won't put yourself in real financial trouble.

2. Don't pay commissions you don't have to

Make sure the brokerage company you use won't charge you commissions. Many brokers have gone commission-free on stock trades, but be especially careful to check if your broker has a special fee on stocks with share prices below a certain level.

3. Get an outside view

Be sure to do some research on the penny stock companies you're interested in. Too often, investors rely solely on information from the company itself or from stock promoters, leaving them prey to fraudulent schemes. If you can't find any information from third-party sources, that in itself is a warning sign that there could be a pump-and-dump going on.

4. Keep it real

Finally, understand that almost no penny stocks make money over the long run. Most of the rare profits that penny stock traders generate come from short-term moves based on emotion rather than facts.

Penny stocks are a dangerous part of the stock market, and many investors have suffered big losses trying to invest in them. With so many well-established companies to invest in, there's little reason to settle for the highly risky companies that you'll find among penny stocks."
55,0.9926,0.105,0.84,0.055,"On the surface, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had a great third quarter. The company built a record number of vehicles. It also achieved a record number of deliveries, although it fell short of its internal goal of delivering 100,000 vehicles. Finally, Tesla continued to rebuild its order backlog during the period, as orders exceeded deliveries.

However, some aspects of Tesla's performance were far less rosy. Demand for the Model S sedan and the Model X crossover -- the electric vehicle pioneer's most lucrative models -- continues to drop off. Furthermore, Tesla reduced the prices of most of its models (again) in July. The resulting decline in its average selling price is making it hard for Tesla to turn a profit, despite its record sales.

Tesla's quarter by the numbers

On Wednesday, Tesla updated investors on its third-quarter production and deliveries. The company built a record 96,155 vehicles last quarter, consisting of 79,837 Model 3s and 16,318 of the pricier Model S and Model X. For comparison, it produced 80,142 vehicles in the third quarter of 2018. The Model 3 accounted for only 53,239 units of its output in the year-ago period, with combined production of the Model S and Model X standing at a far more substantial 26,903 units.

Delivery trends roughly tracked these changes in production. Tesla delivered 56,065 Model 3s in the third quarter of 2018, along with 27,710 Model S and Model X vehicles. The company hasn't finalized its numbers for Q3 2019, but it estimates 79,600 deliveries for the Model 3 and 17,400 for the Model S and Model X combined. That would put its delivery total for the quarter at a record 97,000 vehicles.

There were some reasons for optimism

On the bright side, Tesla delivered nearly 16% more vehicles last quarter than it did in the prior-year period. Additionally, Tesla's delivery total increased nearly 2% sequentially.

This sequential increase in deliveries was particularly positive news because the company had to overcome another decline in the U.S. federal tax credit for Tesla purchases that went into effect on July 1. Additionally, the launch of the Model 3 outside of North America and initial availability of the $35,000 base model had helped juice deliveries in the second quarter. As a result, there had been a risk that Tesla would suffer another sequential decline in deliveries (and production), as occurred in Q1 2019.

In another good sign for the company, Tesla booked a record number of net orders last quarter and increased its order backlog during the period. The company doesn't officially report orders, but CEO Elon Musk said in late September that Tesla was tracking toward 110,000 orders for the quarter. Investors should take this figure with a grain of salt, though, given Musk's penchant for hyperbole.

Tesla is stuck in a quagmire -- at least for now

Notwithstanding these positive developments, Tesla's production and deliveries update was disappointing overall. Most importantly, it reinforced the lack of a clear path to profitability based on Tesla's current business.

Prior to the update, analysts were estimating (on average) that Tesla would swing to a loss of $0.41 per share for the third quarter, excluding stock-based compensation. For comparison, it posted earnings per share of $2.90 in Q3 2018 but a loss of $1.12 per share in Q2 2019 on that basis.

Considering that Tesla delivered only slightly more vehicles last quarter than it did a quarter earlier -- with Model S and Model X deliveries down modestly on a sequential basis -- it seems unlikely that the company improved upon its Q2 earnings results dramatically. While Tesla has been reducing its production costs, its July price cuts probably offset any savings it achieved over the past three months.

Thus, Tesla will probably report another sizable loss for the third quarter, even excluding stock-based compensation, which is a massive expense in itself. Normal-course cost reductions may enable Tesla to reduce its losses over time, but they don't represent a path to sustainable profitability.

Everything is riding on China and the Model Y

Instead, Tesla is counting on catalysts such as the opening of its first factory in China (expected later this month) and the introduction of the Model Y crossover in late 2020 to begin churning out substantial and sustainable profits.

To be fair, both of these developments could be hugely positive for Tesla's business. By building the Model 3 in China, Tesla will be able to avoid hefty import tariffs and offer more competitive pricing in the world's largest electric vehicle market. Meanwhile, the Model Y is likely to be even more popular (and more profitable) than the Model 3 in the long run, as consumer demand has shifted dramatically from sedans to crossovers.

That said, the Chinese economy has hit a rough patch, at least partly due to an escalating trade war with the U.S. Auto sales have peaked in many other key markets, too. Thus, the macroeconomic background isn't favorable for Tesla to achieve the massive earnings growth it would need to justify its sky-high valuation."
56,0.9961,0.108,0.832,0.061,"The stock of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may be the most controversial in the market. Founded in 2003 and a public company since 2010, Tesla is the first new car company in the U.S. to go public since 1956. As you might have heard by now, Tesla's entrance has shaken up the entire U.S. and global auto industry by making electric vehicles ""cool."" But its disrupter status has also attracted a fair amount of naysayers, who point to the company's lack of profitability as it tries to upend an entire established industry from scratch.

Tesla made its initial big splash with the luxury Roadster in 2008, then followed up this concept car with the 2012 release of the Model S, a high-end sedan at prices starting around $75,000. Three years later, in 2015, Tesla released the Model X, a luxury SUV starting at just over $80,000. But the biggest product release came in mid-2017, when Tesla released its first mass-market vehicle,the Model 3, which starts at $35,000. The next model will be the Model Y, a crossover vehicle, or ""CUV,"" which will have a slightly higher price than the Model 3, but will also be more profitable. Its production is set for the fall of 2020. Then there are also plans for a future Tesla pickup truck and a Tesla semitruck as well.

So if you're an investor thinking about purchasing Tesla's stock, how should you think about the company? While many on Wall Street tend to focus on each quarter's deliveries, that probably isn't the best way to look at Tesla as a long-term investment. Here are four charts that show Tesla's huge accomplishments, its potential risks, and the state of the business from a 10,000-foot view.

1. Booming revenue growth

As you can see, Tesla has executed incredible revenue growth over the past five years, growing over sevenfold, from just $3.2 billion in sales in 2014 to $24.9 billion over the 12 months ended in June. As you can also see, much of the gain has come in the past two years, as production of the mass-market Model 3 rose to meet high demand. Last quarter, Tesla grew its automotive revenue 44%.

However, as you'll also see, the massive increase in Model 3 units hasn't come easy.

2. Debt, capital spending, and Tesla's big build

Here you can see the big increase in Tesla's capital spending during 2017 as it built its giant ""Gigafactory"" in Nevada, production capabilities in Fremont, California, for the Model 3, and new service centers and infrastructure to support the influx of new customers from a mass-market vehicle.

Higher spending produced an increased debt load, including secured senior notes as well as convertible debt -- a point on which Tesla bears tend to focus. However, as you can also see, many of these expenditures were one-offs, or at least elevated compared to Tesla's baseline levels of spending. In addition, the company's net debt has begun to flatten out -- at least for now.

Of course, 2018 didn't mark the end of Tesla's capital spending, as it will soon be expanding into Model Y production and moving its China Gigafactory toward higher production levels this year. However, according to management, capital expenditures for 2019 will be only $1.5 billion to $2 billion, down from previous guidance, and down from $2.3 billion in 2018 and the high of $3.4 billion in 2017. Even more encouraging is that management claims it isn't putting off any projects, but rather finding more efficiencies in its construction and manufacturing processes due to past experience.

3. Gross margins, earnings, and cash flows

As spending went up, you can also see that the Model 3 has hit Tesla's margins. That's not only because the Model 3 has lower gross margins than the Model X and Model S, but also because of the high fixed costs needed to mass-produce a car. Like capital spending, Tesla's net losses have piled up over the past year; however, as the company is now reaching scale, you can also see that its net losses are narrowing. So while Tesla's net income is still firmly in the negative, it's moving in the right direction.

Additionally, you may also notice the more encouraging sign on the bottom part of the graph: soaring (and positive!) free cash flow in 2019. Tesla has achieved positive free cash as capital expenditures have come down and sales have surged. However, before you get too excited, beware of a big asterisk next to that cash flow story.

4. Working capital plunged

Tesla calculates free cash flow as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures, but embedded in that operating cash flow story are both earnings and changes in working capital. Working capital includes inventory and accounts receivable, which use cash, subtracted from accrued liabilities and salaries, which produce cash, as they are costs that have not yet been paid. In Tesla's case, it really ramped up production in the latter half of 2018, but also generated lots of cash by incurring negative working capital -- basically, increasing its accrued liabilities and payables to suppliers.

That longer payment schedule may have been perfectly legitimate, as suppliers often agree to longer payment schedules for bigger and bigger payments, which Tesla incurred as it ramped up Model 3 production. However, investors shouldn't take this increase in operating cash as the norm -- a big increase in payables to suppliers and employees is more like a short-term loan than actual cash generation, and eventually these employees and suppliers will have to be paid.

The big picture

The overall picture for Tesla is one of a company that has reached the summit of a huge production ramp for the Model 3 -- a very impressive feat. Now that this big spending period has ended, it looks as if net losses are turning the corner and could even turn into gains soon.

However, bulls shouldn't be celebrating just yet. As the company's dip into working capital last year showed, Tesla is pulling all sorts of minor miracles to keep its debt-fueled mass production ramp going, and the company is not done introducing new models, even though it's not yet profitable. After all, the company just raised even more convertible debt and issued equity in May to fatten its balance sheet.

Investors need to figure out if Tesla can continue its massive revenue growth without as much expense growth or the need for more capital. It will be hard to figure out, as the Model 3 is growing and maturing while the Model Y and China Gigafactory will also be ramping up their production levels at the same time. Therefore, investors should try to isolate the economics of just the Model 3, and filter out the new ""growth"" spending on future vehicle makes. Hopefully, management can separate these different buckets of spending for investors."
57,0.9914,0.122,0.878,0.0,"Autonomous vehicles are set to revolutionize the concept of transport while contributing significantly to the global economy. To capitalize on the changing dynamics of the auto industry, Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) recently acquired DeepScale, a California-based computer vision startup, in order to develop fully driverless cars. The startup focuses on “deep neural networks” that use data and provide information to help a vehicle’s in-car driverless technology “see” what's around it more effectively.

DeepScale’s Artificial Intelligence software for vehicles is named as Craver21. DeepScale engineering will optimize Tesla hardware to allow its vehicles to perform autonomous driving seamlessly. The buyout adds the much-needed talent to Tesla Autopilot team, which has seen the departure of a number of Autopilot executives and engineers in the past year. The financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps.

Tesla’s vehicles are not considered fully autonomous, i.e. Level 4, a designation by the Society of Automobile Engineers which means that the vehicle can operate in certain conditions without human intervention. Instead, vehicles from Tesla are Level 2.

While Tesla is making attempts to perfect its self-driving technologies, the company is at the top of its game when it comes to electric vehicles. Although electric cars occupy a small portion of the global automobile market, Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within this niche segment. With Model 3 sedan being its flagship vehicle, Tesla has established itself as a leader in the EV segment. Notably, the company delivered a record 97,000 vehicles globally in the third quarter.

While Tesla has been bearing the brunt of increasing R&D and SG&A costs, which have been denting profits; rising Model 3 delivery, which accounts for the bulk of its overall deliveries, is likely to aid its prospects.

58,0.9716,0.106,0.839,0.055,"In Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) update on quarterly deliveries Wednesday, it was clear that the Model 3 continues to win over consumers. Deliveries of the vehicle hit a new quarterly record of 79,600 and accounted for 82% of total deliveries. Compared to the year-ago period, Model 3 deliveries were up 42%.

Even more notable, the company said in its third-quarter update on deliveries that nearly all of its Model 3 orders during the quarter were from customers without previous reservations, ""solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand.""

The narrative for Tesla's flagship Model S and Model X vehicles, however, is quite different. Sales of the high-priced vehicles have fallen sharply in recent quarters.

Declining deliveries

In Tesla's third quarter, reported Model S and Model X deliveries fell to 17,400, from 17,722 in Q2. To be fair, Wednesday's update on deliveries doesn't represent official numbers for the period. Moreover, the company says investors should consider the estimates to be conservative, as it takes some time to verify whether all paperwork associated with deliveries during the quarter was correct. This means deliveries could have actually held steady compared to Q2.

But there's no good excuse for the sharp year-over-year decline in combined Model S and Model X deliveries: They were down 37% compared to the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, combined deliveries of these two vehicles were down in each of the last four quarters, with trailing-12-month Model S and Model X deliveries down 25% year over year.

It's safe to say that Tesla's Model 3, which was launched in 2017 but didn't see meaningful production volumes until the second half of 2018, is cannibalizing some Model S and Model X deliveries.

This isn't entirely surprising. The Model 3 has a starting price of about half of the Model S and Model X. And while the Model S and Model X are larger vehicles with bigger batteries and feature more impressive specs, the Model 3 is built with Tesla's latest touchscreen design and represents the company's latest vision for electric cars. Since the Model 3 is its newest vehicle, many customers may be convinced that it features Tesla's latest innovations and offers a more compelling value proposition than the Model S and Model X.

Why it matters

Lower Model S and Model X deliveries are weighing on Tesla's business.

When combined Model S and Model X deliveries declined 45% between the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, the company's total gross profit margin fell from 24.3% in Q4 to 20.2% in Q1. While part of this was due to a slight decline in the Model 3's gross margin over the same time frame, much of this contraction was the result of reduced Model S and Model X delivery volume. This is no surprise: As Tesla's priciest models, Model S and Model X produce higher gross profit margin than the Model 3.

Perhaps Tesla has some surprises in store to reignite sales volume for its Model S and Model X in the coming quarters. But if it doesn't, it will have to rely primarily on improved economies of scale from higher Model 3 volumes in order to improve its automotive gross profit margin."

With an aim to increase delivery numbers, Tesla announced in September 2019 that it will offer customers 2 years of free supercharging and other incentives.

Tesla expected deliveries in 2019 to be between 360,000 and 400,000 units. It will be possible only if the company can deliver around 105,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Almost all Model 3 orders were received from customers, who previously did not have reservations, thereby demonstrating strong organic demand.

Apart from vehicle delivery, factors such as cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles influence the company’s quarterly results.

Tesla’s China-based factory is expected to produce 3,000 Model 3s by the end of the year. Musk said in August that progress at its Shanghai factory was “mind blowing” and he never saw anything like it. So once that comes online, there will be more cars that are also closer to the market to which it’s selling, which should therefore accelerate deliveries.

While Tesla has been bearing the brunt of increasing R&D and SG&A costs, which have been denting profits; rising Model 3 delivery, which accounts for the bulk of its overall deliveries, is likely to aid its prospects.

60,0.9935,0.12,0.849,0.031,"In typical fashion, Elon Musk created that seemingly insurmountable hurdle and then attempted to clear it.

When the company was still ironing out the “perfect” assembly that would allow it to churn out thousands of vehicles a week, when the street was still trying to figure out what would be feasible, Musk started setting out targets for himself and Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) , things that his critics could continue calling him out on, every time he missed them.

But there’s an important lesson there about goal setting. You’re supposed to set targets that look just that much out of reach, so in endeavoring to reach it, you rev up your energy, innovation, creativity, you name it, to get there. And it doesn’t really matter that you didn’t hit that target, because you came up pretty close.

Maybe even close enough to hit that really ambitious target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year. As I was saying in an earlier blog, the growth trajectory is awesome, it’s exciting and it brings confidence in the company’s ability to deliver an ever-growing number of vehicles. Delivery is clearly an issue right now because all the cars are shipping from the U.S. But The Chinese factory will soon get into production, which will ease things a bit.

Musk says that backlog continues to grow and that the company is doing all it can to meet the strong demand it’s seeing. Not quite there yet, but this is a good problem to have.

Another little tidbit that some investors could be concerned about is the growing percentage of vehicles under lease accounting. This essentially means that Tesla won’t recover the entire cost upfront, but will receive it in some sort of instalments. Obviously, the near term impact is negative as revenues are lowered, especially for a company in its early growth phase as it also limits cash flow. So the fact that 15% of Model S and X and 8% of Model 3 deliveries were leases, up from a respective10% and 5.6% in the previous quarter, can be something to keep an eye on.

In the slightly longer term however, it can’t be considered negative at all because of the improved visibility in out quarters and the stability it brings to revenue.

Let’s Take a Look at the Numbers

Tesla delivered 97,000 vehicles in the last quarter, compared with 99,000 expected and an internal target of 100,000.

Of these, 79,600 (82.1%) were Model 3 sedans and 17,400 (17.9%) were Model S cars and Model X crossovers. Of the 84,000 delivered in the previous quarter, 56,000 (66.7%) were Model 3s. The growing mix of lower-end Model 3s and declining sales of the higher-end vehicles are likely to impact margins.

The U.S., China, Norway and the Netherlands are its biggest markets. While the company doesn’t mention region-wise performance in its quarterly delivery statement, a Reuters news report that studied registration data in Norway, said that at 3,300 units, the Model 3 was the top-selling car in the country. The number is however down from Norwegian Road Federation numbers of 6,123 in the first quarter and 4,438 in the second.

Recommendations

Tesla shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So buy-ranked General Motors Company (GM - Free Report) , IAA, Inc. (IAA - Free Report) and Douglas Dynamics, Inc. (PLOW - Free Report) are better stocks to buy right now.

61,0.875,0.061,0.918,0.021,"What happened

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) took a hit on Thursday, falling as much as 7.8%. As of 11:36 a.m. EDT, the stock was down 6.6%.

The stock's decline follows Tesla's third-quarter update on vehicle production and deliveries. Shares are likely down because deliveries were below analysts' average forecast for the period.

So what

Tesla said it delivered a record 97,000 vehicles in its third quarter. This was up from the company's previous quarterly record, which was set in the second quarter of 2019, of 95,356 vehicles. But it was below what analysts were looking for. On average, analysts were expecting Tesla to deliver 99,000 vehicles during the period.

Total vehicle deliveries were up 16% year over year. Model 3 deliveries continued to drive Tesla's growth, accounting for 82% of the quarter's deliveries.

Management said it produced a record 96,155 vehicles during the period, up from 87,048 vehicles in Q2.

Now what

Demand for the company's vehicles remains strong, with Tesla's order backlog higher going into Q4 than it was going into Q3. In addition, management said most of its Model 3 orders are coming from customers who didn't previously have a reservation, ""solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand.""

In Q4, Tesla said it will focus on increasing production to meet higher demand."
62,0.9945,0.112,0.862,0.026,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is giving consumers more reasons to purchase one of its electric cars: the ability to summon the vehicle and to partake in some in-vehicle karaoke.

In what the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company said is its ""biggest software update ever,"" Tesla announced in late September the rollout of Version 10.0 or V10 of its software. It was issued as an over-the-air update, which means no intervention by car owners is required.

With the update, Tesla vehicle owners who have purchased the full self-driving capability (not yet released) or enhanced autopilot can summon their vehicle from a parking lot without a driver behind the wheel. The car has to remain in the owner's line of sight, and owners are responsible for monitoring it at all times.

Tesla is also enabling customers to stream Netflix, Alphabet 'sYouTube, and Walt Disney 's Hulu while the vehicle is in park and use its new ""Car-aoke"" feature, which comes with what Tesla said is a ""massive"" library of music and song lyrics, with support for multiple languages.

""We're raising the bar for what people have come to expect from their cars with new entertainment, gaming, music, and convenience features designed to make your car much more capable, as well as making time spent in your car more fun,"" Tesla wrote in a blog post when announcing the upgrade. ""Version 10.0 is our largest update ever.""

Tesla hopes V10 drives sales growth

The software update coincided with a quarter-end push by Tesla to sell more vehicles. And how better than with new technology that lets you summon your vehicle in the rain or when you're loaded down with packages?

As the quarter closed out last week, consumers were urged to purchase a Tesla in promotional emails that threw in perks like unlimited free supercharging for two years, according to media reports. The promos also touted the V10 software update.

That wasn't enough, however, for Tesla to meet Wall Street's expectations for 99,000 deliveries in Q3. On Wednesday, the company announced it delivered 97,000 vehicles during the September-ending quarter. Specifically, Tesla said it delivered 79,600 Model 3 cars and 17,400 Model S and X cars. It bested its second-quarter sales, which hit a record 95,365.

Full-year sales outlook sets the stock's trajectory

Even more important in the minds of investors is what Tesla had to say about sales heading into the important fourth quarter. Tesla said the backlog is strong as the last three-month period of the year kicks off and that it's focused on boosting production to meet that demand.

""As was also the case in Q2, nearly all of our Model 3 orders were received from customers who did not previously hold a reservation, solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand. We are continuing to focus on increasing production to meet that demand,"" Tesla wrote in the press release highlighting third-quarter sales results.

It is that organic demand that Tesla is hoping to boost with its new software update. After all, by the time we are in the throes of the fourth quarter, reviewers will have had time to pore over the features and scores of Tesla owners would have already tried to summon their car. If the reviews are good and customers are happy, V10 could boost interest in the electric vehicle maker. But reports of driverless cars hitting other vehicles (or worse, people) or entertainment features from the software update failing to deliver could tarnish Tesla's reputation. That's wouldn't be good for investors or for the electric-car maker, which is already under pressure."
63,0.9992,0.201,0.775,0.024,"Tesla Motors (TSLA - Free Report) disappointed investors by reporting weaker-than-expected deliveries for the third quarter. The company delivered record 97,000 (79,600 Model 3 and 17,400 Model S and X) vehicles, which is higher than 84,000 vehicles delivered in the year-ago quarter. However, the number fell short of analysts’ expectation of 99,000 polled by FactSet.
The electric carmaker said that it achieved ""record"" net orders in the third quarter and is seeing an increase in its order backlog in the current quarter. Nearly all of its Model 3 orders came from people who did not hold a reservation, ""solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand.""
Overall, Tesla continues to deliver 360,000-400,000 vehicles in 2019, indicating growth of 45-65% from 2018. It hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles a year globally in the 12-month period ending Jun 30, 2020 and reaffirmed a target of producing 10,000 vehicles per week by the end of 2019. The company also continues to target 25% non-GAAP gross margin on Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles (see: all the Alternative Energy ETFs here).
Further, the company is likely to break even in the third quarter and return to profitability in the fourth quarter. Tesla remains on track to start local production of Model 3 in China by the end of the year.
Following the data release, shares of TSLA tumbled nearly 6% in after-hours trading. Tesla currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and VGM Score of C. It belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (in the top 45%).

64,0.631,0.054,0.909,0.037,"Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell in after-hours trading on Wednesday, following the release of the electric-car maker's third-quarter delivery and production numbers. While there were more vehicles produced and delivered than in any quarter in the company's history, the company ultimately fell short of analysts' consensus forecast for the period.

Here's a look at the third-quarter delivery and production numbers, as well as what management said about demand for its vehicles.

Record deliveries and growing demand

Tesla's third-quarter deliveries rose 16% year over year to a record high of 97,000. This is up 2% sequentially from 95,356 deliveries in the company's second quarter.

Of these deliveries, 79,600 were Model 3 and 17,400 were either Model S or Model X. Model 3 deliveries, up 42% year over year, continued their sharp upward climb during the quarter. But combined Model S and X deliveries continue to sell at suppressed levels compared to 2018, declining 37% year over year. Sequentially, Model 3 deliveries increased 3% and combined Model S and X deliveries fell 2%.

Importantly, Tesla's production rate continued to improve. The automaker produced a record 96,155 vehicles during the quarter, up from 87,048 in Q2.

Tesla also confirmed that demand for its vehicles remains robust, as the company once again ended the quarter with an increase in order backlog. Further, Tesla said it continues to attract new customers.

""As was also the case in Q2, nearly all of our Model 3 orders were received from customers who did not previously hold a reservation, solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand,"" Tesla explained in its update on Wednesday.

Looking ahead, the company said it will focus on further improving production in order to meet growing demand.

Why the Street is disappointed

Though deliveries were up both year over year and sequentially, they ultimately fell short of analysts' consensus forecast for about 99,000 deliveries. Further, disappointment may have been magnified by a recently leaked email from Tesla CEO Elon Musk telling employees that a quarter of 100,000 deliveries was within reach but would require ""rallying"" the company's resources and a strong effort from employees. This may have led many investors to believe deliveries during the period would be closer to 100,000 than they were.

Nevertheless, the delivery figures from the quarter were big enough to put Tesla's full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,00 deliveries within reach. To hit the low end of its guidance, Tesla will need to deliver about 105,000 vehicles during its fourth quarter. Given that Tesla's deliveries typically rise sequentially during Q4, hitting the low end of this guidance range seems possible.

Hitting the high end of this guidance range, however, would likely require some contribution from the company's new factory in Shanghai, which is expected to start production before the end of the year. It's unclear whether or not production at the factory will start early enough for Tesla to record any deliveries of vehicles made at the Shanghai factory during 2019."
65,0.9635,0.109,0.815,0.076,"Many of us had a terrible, no-good, bad day on the stock market Wednesday. Investors are nervous about the prospects for the economy, and spooked about the increasingly heated rhetoric coming from the most powerful politicians in the land.

As a result, even the most popular top stocks really took it on the chin today. These three companies, however, suffered more than most. Both sank lower than even the most battered stock indexes. Let's examine these victims.

Tesla

Although Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock did relatively well during the trading day, it was crushed in after-market action, down 4% as of this writing. The reason why is clear and obvious: Following market close, it released its latest production and delivery numbers.

At first glance, those figures were impressive. In the third quarter, the company produced 96,155 vehicles and delivered roughly 97,000. The latter was a new quarterly record.

It wasn't, however, up to expectations. On average, analysts were anticipating 99,000, while CEO Elon Musk's ambition was an even 100,000. No investor likes when one of their companies misses a key target, and since Tesla is a volatile, knife's-edge operator, the market can react strongly to such news. This is what seems to be the case here.

If I were considering Tesla stock, though, I wouldn't trade off the current or recent delivery/production numbers. The carmaker has found its niche, and in many ways it's become the poster boy for alternatives to the internal combustion engine.

Basically, an investment in Tesla is a bet on Musk, a very hands-on manager with lofty ideas and soaring ambitions. If you feel he's the kind of guy who can fulfill these, you should go along for the ride and buy on current weakness. Personally, I have my doubts, but to each his or her own.

TD Ameritrade and E*Trade

In a race, there are no prizes for coming in at the rear of the pack. That's what is happening with online securities brokers TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC), which announced they were dropping their trading commissions to every consumer's favorite price, $0.

This closely follows a similar move made by Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), which on Monday announced it was entirely eliminating its own commissions. It's not the first brokerage to kill such fees, but up to that point it was the most influential.

A shocked and surprised market rid itself of E*Trade and TD Ameritrade with a massive sell-off, with the stocks down 3.6% and 3.3%, respectively, at market close. Comparatively speaking, today's trading was far less damaging to the stock prices.

The fundamentals of both will, obviously, take a hit from the lost revenue. But this is 2019, not 1989, and brokerages aren't so heavily reliant on the take from commissions anymore.

I'm bullish on the brokerage sector generally, as a still-thriving economy should support continued strong activity. I also like TD Ameritrade specifically -- heck, I'm a longtime shareholder -- because the company has proven nimble and clever in staying competitive as a brokerage and finding ways to keep growing.

That's no mean feat in a business with a great many bread-and-butter services offered by a host of rivals. So personally, I'm holding onto my shares. However, those considering TD Ameritrade (or E*Trade, while we're at it) as an investment might want to wait and see how the company makes up for the sharp and sudden loss of a classic revenue stream."
66,0.9942,0.121,0.856,0.023,"It seems an understatement to say Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot team has endured more than its fair share of strife. Under the weight of Elon Musk's aggressive self-driving vehicle goals -- including a targeted late-2020 launch for a fully autonomous fleet of Tesla RoboTaxis -- the group has churned through four leaders since 2016. The most recent shake-up this summer resulted in an exodus of at least 11 software engineers, reportedly including some longtime employees, repesenting nearly 10% of Tesla's Autopilot engineering staff.

Late Tuesday, however, Tesla breathed fresh life into its self-driving ambitions by quietly acquiring DeepScale (according to sources speaking with CNBC), a 4-year-old AI start-up focused on advancing deep neural networks (DNNs) for use in autonomous vehicles. Terms for the deal weren't disclosed, indicating it wasn't a particularly large acquisition, but DeepScale previously raised more than $18 million in venture capital funding since it was founded in late 2015.

To be clear, Tesla hasn't independently confirmed the purchase just yet. But DeepScale co-founder and CEO Forrest Iandola did indirectly acknowledge the move with a Tweet:

I joined the @Tesla #Autopilot team this week. I am looking forward to working with some of the brightest minds in #deeplearning and #autonomousdriving.

— Forrest Iandola (@fiandola) October 1, 2019

More specifically, DeepScale specializes in ""squeezing"" artificial intelligence, or making ""an AI system use less resources by whatever means necessary.""

More to Tesla's purpose, DeepScale's proprietary ""Carver21"" software was created as a modular solution to easily integrate with other businesses' self-driving vehicle sensors, technology, and chips.

That aligns perfectly with Tesla's proprietary self-driving chip, which was formally unveiled at its Autonomy Day presentation this past April and targets using no more than 250 watts to ensure it won't negatively impact the vehicles' battery range.

But make no mistake: This acquisition is as much about pulling in high-quality engineering talent as it is about supplementing Tesla's own self-driving vehicle technology. According to DeepScale's website, 25% of its engineering team already have doctoral degrees -- including both company co-founders Iandola and Kurt Keutzer -- and together that team boasts more than 30,000 scholarly citations.

And putting aside the financial terms of the purchase, why wouldn't this well-educated group want to join Tesla's fold? With hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles already on the road continuously collecting hoards of self-driving vehicle data, the enormous data advantage enjoyed by the company in these early stages of the self-driving vehicle race is enough to make any self-respecting AI scientist giddy with anticipation.

What remains to be seen, however, is whether the DeepScale team is able to successfully assimilate both its personnel and its AI technology into the high-pressure environment Elon Musk seems to thrive on fostering. If they can succeed to that end, this small acquisition could ultimately prove to be exactly what Tesla needs to propel its Autopilot capabilities into the future."
67,0.9518,0.075,0.87,0.055,"A company with an erratic founder, significant direct report turnover that includes key executives, careening cash levels, and questionable strategy would usually trigger investors' alarm bells. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has adroitly deflected these concerns with bold reiterations of Tesla's future prospects, and his contention that concerning items in annual and quarterly reports are one-offs. But company fundamentals indicate they aren't. Worse, Tesla's cool factor and novelty may be about to run out.

Competition from all sides

Tesla has dominated the U.S. EV market in the 11 years since it created that market. And thus far, Tesla's been the biggest occupant in a largely empty space. That's about to change.

The definitive wave of EVs from major players will hit the U.S. in 2020. They're cheaper than Teslas, often offer similar performance, and range from inexpensive compact entrants, to seven-passenger people-haulers, to a pickup truck. And these mass-market offerings are accompanied by pricier, sexier entrants from Europe's most esteemed automakers, with histories (unlike Tesla) of delivering on time.

Cheaper models include a pared-down Mini Cooper and the eagerly awaited 2020 Ford (NYSE:F) Bronco Scout, both under $30,000. And Volvo designed the Polestar to eat away at the Model 3 market, which comprises the bulk of Tesla sales.

Serious threats on the high-end side include Mercedes 's (OTC:DDAI.F) launch of the Holy Grail for upscale, eco-minded families: a minivan. Porsche (OTC:POAH.Y) is throwing in an EV SUV alongside its Turbo Taycan sports car. Even Aston Martin 's getting in on the game, with a $200,000-plus EV.

And suddenly, just like that, Tesla's facing a slew of worthy competitors for every vehicle in its lineup – and ceding first-mover status on the body types it hasn't launched yet.

The timing couldn't be worse

So what's next for Tesla as it loses the benefit from first-mover status? Growing pains, it would appear. Tesla swapped out the niche luxury market for the mass market in 2018 with the launch of the $35,000 Model 3. A Tesla purchase at that price was irresistible but not sustainable, it turns out, due to production delays and higher-than-anticipated costs.

The company launched a new pricing model in April that pared back premium features on the Standard T3 at a $38,000 price. The company was trying to steer drivers to more expensive T3 models with premium features, such as the fully loaded Standard Plus at $51,200, and the fully loaded Long Range at $61,2000. It's not clear yet how irresistible the Model 3 will be at the more profitable price points. With the Model 3 comprising 93.5% of Tesla sales in 1Q19 and 80.8% of Tesla sales in Q2 2019, that's an enormous question. .

Musk has reaffirmed Tesla's guidance of 360,000-400,000 total vehicle deliveries in 2019, but softening sales argue against it. By InsideEV's calculation, sales have slowed. A lot. Tesla's first-half 2019 deliveries figure of 158,714 would include InsideEV's estimate of June deliveries of 21,225. By those same estimates, things turned ugly in July and August, with deliveries of 13,450 and 13,150, respectively. If these figures hold up, then Tesla will have to deliver at least 174,687 cars in the back half of 2019, including the pricier and more profitable QS and QX. That could be challenging. In late September, Musk told employees that the company ""has a shot"" at delivering 100,000 Tesla vehicles in Q3. But given his past statements, we'll wait and see whether that proves true.

The Model 3 has proven a costly car

Tesla's already paid dearly for the Model 3. As Model 3 sales dropped and a too-low price point reduced its profits, the company lost a combined $1.11 billion in the first half of 2019. Tesla has cut costs aggressively, by shuttering stores, taking sales online, and reducing financial allocations to various divisions to boost cash flow. It turned to public markets for capital, but the $2.4 billion Tesla raised may not be enough. That capital infusion wasn't the ""contingency buffer"" Musk had said it would be. It was a last-ditch effort to counteract a burn rate that would level the company otherwise. according to a staff memo leaked to the EV news site Electrek.

When Tesla announces Q3 results, investors will have better chance to gauge Tesla's immediate future and decide whether it's earned a continued investment That assessment won't be easy. Investors have always bought into what's next for Tesla, not what's now. In a newly crowded electric-vehicle market, those investors have one more factor to consider."
68,0.9618,0.071,0.903,0.027,"Sometime between today and Oct. 3, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will release its quarterly deliveries. It's the electric car maker's policy to announce its vehicle delivery and production numbers within three days of a quarter's end.

In Tesla's second quarter, the company delivered a record 95,356 vehicles. The surging deliveries importantly helped the company narrow its operating loss and achieve positive free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures). In order to keep realizing the benefits of scaling its business, however, Tesla will need to continue to grow its deliveries in the coming quarters.

Can Tesla's quarterly deliveries rise to a new high in Q3?

Tesla's guidance

Going into Tesla's third quarter, the pressure was mounting for the automaker to achieve strong delivery numbers for the period. Ever since its fourth-quarter update earlier this year, management has been guiding for a total of 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries in 2019 -- a range that represents 45% to 65% year-over-year growth. But Tesla delivered just 158,375 vehicles during the first half of the year. This meant the automaker needed nearly 202,000 deliveries in the second half of the year just to hit the low end of its guidance range.

Fortunately, the company's second-quarter deliveries of more than 95,000 suggested Tesla wasn't too far from the pace it needs to achieve in the second half of 2019 in order to hit its guidance. But there are no guarantees -- especially when Tesla is producing and delivering at volumes far beyond what it has ever done in its history.

While Tesla didn't provide a specific figure for what to expect from its third-quarter deliveries, management did say it expected total deliveries to increase sequentially during the period.

Expect close to 100,000 deliveries

Leading up to Tesla's third-quarter vehicle deliveries announcement, there has been some evidence that the electric-car maker is on track to achieve a new quarterly record for vehicle deliveries.

Namely, CEO Elon Musk told employees last week in a leaked email (via Electrek) that the company was within reach of 100,000 deliveries during the quarter. He said demand was sufficient to achieve deliveries at this volume and that the challenge would be delivery logistics. Hitting 100,000 deliveries during the period will require ""rallying"" its resources, the CEO said in the email.

A hundred thousand deliveries during the period would also represent 5% sequential growth and a new quarterly record. In addition, it would likely put the company on pace with its target to be profitable in the second half of the year -- an achievement that could help the Street think of the growth stock in a new light.

Stay tuned for an update from Tesla on quarterly production and deliveries sometime between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3."
69,0.9817,0.101,0.846,0.054,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped almost 8% in the last week of September following news of a leaked email from CEO Elon Musk that revealed the company may set new records for vehicle deliveries.

The leaked email from Musk to Tesla employees said, in part, that the company may reach 100,000 vehicles delivered in the third quarter.

Some analysts predicted that a delivery report of at least 95,000 for the third quarter would be positive news for Tesla, and that investors would react by buying shares if the company reached that benchmark. If Tesla were indeed able to exceed 100,000 vehicles delivered for its third quarter -- which it's expected to report at its third-quarter earnings call this week -- more good times could be ahead for the company's stock.

Deliveries don't tell the whole story

In July, Tesla's stock price increased more than 15% after Musk released the company's deliveries report for the second quarter. In that report, Tesla revealed it achieved ""record deliveries of 95,356 vehicles and record production of 87,048 vehicles, surpassing our previous quarterly records of ~91,000 deliveries and ~86,600 units produced in Q4 of 2018.""

Model 3 deliveries reached an all-time high in the second quarter, at 77,634, making it the ""best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S., outselling all of its gas-powered equivalents combined,"" according to Musk's summary of the Q2 earnings.

Naturally, investors responded positively by indicating Tesla was a solid buy. Those celebrations didn't last very long, though, as the stock plummeted almost 14% overnight from July 24 to July 25 following the company's second-quarter report.

The reason for the drop was Tesla was way off in earnings per share estimates, thanks in large part to a ""weaker-than-expected automotive gross margin,"" according to The Street. That number was 18.9% for the quarter ended June 30, after it had been above 20% for the quarters ended March 31, 2019, and June 30, 2018.

Investors' response to the second-quarter earnings call was quite simple: Deliveries are nice, but there is much more that goes into Tesla's valuation.

How Tesla's stock has performed since

Tesla's $228.82 stock price on July 25 eventually dropped to $211.40 on Aug. 23. Both numbers were still well above the year-to-date low for the company, which was $178.97 back on June 3.

Since the Aug. 23 low, the stock has been on a relatively consistent incline. At the market's close on Sept. 30, Tesla's stock price sat at $240.87, a hefty 35% higher than the year's low, but 31% lower than the year's peak of $347.26 on Jan. 11.

Fluctuating prices are nothing really new for Tesla. It reached as high as $383.45 on June 23, 2017, spiking up and down quickly in response to deliveries, earnings calls and expectations.

Overall, Tesla hasn't performed very well this year. June's low was the lowest point it had reached since the beginning of 2017. Plus, after saying it wouldn't need to raise more money, the company raised $2.7 billion in convertible debt and equity this year, according to Quartz.

Net losses in the first and second quarters, the departure of CTO and co-founder J.B. Straubel, and the delay of production of Model 3 vehicles at the company's Shanghai gigafactory also combined to scare some investors off.

The outlook for Tesla going forward

The market has shown that, while deliveries are important in the short-term, the true indication of the long-term value of Tesla is whether the company can improve its earnings and cash flow. Three months ago, the company's stock received a boost from its delivery report, but then dropped back down swiftly following its full earnings call for the quarter.

It's possible that a similar increase then drop-off could occur later this week following Tesla's third-quarter earnings call if the company's earnings per share are low once again.

For the long-term, though, it has to be seen as a positive that Tesla is continuing to deliver a record number of sales and deliveries. The Model S capturing the top spot in the luxury sedan sector is a huge positive, and sales could continue to climb as more consumers decide to make the switch to electric vehicles.

Long-term investors may hope for a drop in Tesla's stock following the Q3 earnings call, as it could provide a nice bargain to start a new position or add to an existing one. Should the company continue to break new sales and delivery records, the long-term value of the stock could soar to new heights."

71,0.9964,0.149,0.819,0.031,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) shares rallied strongly to the news that the company was within shouting distance of a 100,000 vehicle delivery milestone.

The eccentric CEO Elon Musk who has been criticized by analysts, market watchers and law enforcement, is in the habit of charging up his employees before quarter-end. That’s what his email was supposed to be doing, when it said,

“We have a shot at achieving our first 100,000 vehicle delivery quarters…Net orders are tracking to reach about 110k, so demand is strong.”

The email somehow leaked out and the contents picked up by EV-focused news website Electrek. If Tesla hits that mark, it will be an encouraging sign, increasing the chances of its reaching the deliveries originally targeted.

The original target was to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year. But the company managed just 63,000 in the first quarter, increasing it to 95,200 in the second. If third and fourth quarters come in at 100,000 each, it will be 358,000, or at around the low end of the guided range.

And if fourth-quarter deliveries improve upon the third quarter levels, the company would have silenced most everyone. Because practically no one thought they’d match guidance.

As the email said, right now, “The challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and rallying as much of our company resources as possible to help with end of quarter deliveries.”

Musk did say that demand for the vehicles remains strong, but investors expect a large chunk of that to come from China because of the country’s initiative to boost EV adoption and the brand’s popularity there.

Tesla’s Chinese factory is expected to produce 3,000 Model 3 EVs by the end of the year. Musk said in August that building progress at its Shanghai factory was “mind blowing” and that he has never seen anything like it. So once that comes online, there will be more cars that are also closer to the market to which it’s selling, which should therefore accelerate deliveries.

Tesla continues to make losses, but the key to profitability is stepping up sales. Since that part is going well, I feel incrementally positive about the company.

Tesla shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Industry players worth buying instead are IAA, Inc. (IAA - Free Report) , Ford Motor Company (F - Free Report) , Fox Factory Holding Corp.

72,0.9892,0.116,0.87,0.014,"With less than a week left in Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) third quarter, many investors are likely wondering how many vehicles the electric-car maker may deliver during the period. While we won't know the exact figure until the company reports its quarterly vehicle delivery and production update early next month, there's evidence the company is well on its way to hitting a new record for quarterly deliveries.

In a leaked email (via Electrek), CEO Elon Musk told employees this week that the automaker ""has a shot"" at racking up 100,000 deliveries during its third quarter -- well over the record 95,356 vehicles it delivered in Q2. The figure would importantly put Tesla on track to hit its ambitious full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.

What we know

Tesla is within reach of delivering a total of 100,000 vehicles in Q2, Musk said in the leaked email to employees. But this will require the company executing well on delivery logistics.

Notably, demand doesn't seem to be an issue, as orders easily surpass the company's delivery target for the period. Net orders are ""tracking to reach about 110,000"" during the quarter, Musk noted. ""The challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and rallying as much as our company resources as possible to help with the end of the quarter deliveries,"" the CEO said.

Staggering growth

Achieving 100,000 in total vehicle deliveries for the quarter would extend the company's incredible growth recently. Quarterly deliveries at this volume would mean that trailing-12-month deliveries for the company up are up nearly 90% year over year.

But Tesla is notably becoming increasingly reliant on continued growth in Model 3 production and deliveries in order to achieve its growth. The vehicle has been the key driver of the company's recent growth. In Tesla's second quarter, for instance, Model 3 deliveries were up 321% year over year. Combined Model S and X deliveries for the period, however, were down 21% year over year. Hitting a new record for total deliveries, therefore, will require more strong sales performance from Model 3.

If Tesla delivers 100,000 total vehicles in Q3, it would translate to 19% year-over-year growth and 5% sequential growth in vehicle deliveries. More importantly, 100,000 quarterly deliveries would put the company on track with its guidance to increase deliveries 45% to 65% year over year in 2019.

Investors should look for an update from Tesla on its vehicle deliveries by Oct. 3. The company typically reports deliveries within three calendar days following a quarter's close."
73,0.9919,0.151,0.824,0.025,"Thursday was a volatile day on Wall Street, even though most major indexes ended up pretty close to where they began the session. There's no shortage of drama available for market participants to look at, ranging from investigations in Washington to nervous speculation about how central banks across the globe will deal with troubling economic trends. Even with the downward pressure, though, some companies had investors feeling more optimistic. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Mobile Mini (NASDAQ:MINI), and WillScot (NASDAQ:WSC) were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well.

Tesla's looking to sell more cars

Shares of Tesla gained 6% after an announcement from the electric vehicle company's leader spurred enthusiasm about its sales prospects. CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla could well hit the 100,000 vehicle mark in terms of deliveries when it next reports quarterly results, which many see as an important milestone for the automaker. Moreover, net order flows seem to be healthy as well, with the potential to come in around 110,000 for the period. Many investors had already started to count Tesla out, but if Musk is right, then customers still seem to be loyal to the automaker's vehicles. That could spur more growth than some thought possible.

WillScot contemplates buying Mobile Mini

Shares of Mobile Mini and WillScot both climbed, rising nearly 7% and 6%, respectively, on news that the two companies might be looking at a combination. Both companies are in the specialty rental services market, and WillScot is looking at making an offer of about $1.2 billion for Mobile Mini, according to reports late yesterday from Reuters. That would imply a share price in the mid-to-high $30s, just slightly above Mobile Mini's closing price Wednesday of $34.75 per share.

Today, analysts weighed in favorably about a possible deal, and Reuters further said that activist hedge fund investor Elliott Management has bought shares of Mobile Mini and will support an acquisition. Mobile Mini has recently started to recover as demand from the energy sector has boosted its tank and pump solutions business, and that could end up proving to be the impetus for getting a deal done between the two companies."
74,0.8674,0.066,0.91,0.024,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped on Thursday. The stock finished the trading day up more than 6%.

The stock's gain follows a string of updates on the company, including the release of a new version of Tesla software, a Chinese news website's report that Tesla has completed its first body-in-white Model 3 at its new factory in China, and a leaked email from CEO Elon Musk to employees stating that the company was close to delivering 100,000 vehicles in its third quarter.

So what

Tesla started rolling out version 10 of its Tesla vehicle software on Thursday. New features include an application called Tesla Theater, where owners can get access to Tesla tutorials and popular streaming services while their vehicles are in park; the ability for owners to ""summon"" their vehicles while in a parking lot; and more.

Meanwhile, the company's alleged completion of a body-in-white Model 3 unit in China suggests Tesla is making progress building production capacity at the new factory. ""Body in white"" refers to the part of the vehicle production process when a vehicle's parts have been put together but before its motors, axles, and other internal parts have been secured inside, or the body is painted.

Finally, news that Tesla is close to 100,000 vehicle deliveries in Q3 implies that the company is on pace for another record quarter.

2019 is a pivotal year for Tesla. The company's losses have been narrowing, and management is guiding for profitability in the second half of the year. But Tesla will need to execute on its aggressive global expansion of the Model 3, and address delivery logistics challenges as its sales climb.

For the full year, Tesla is aiming for vehicle deliveries to increase 45% to 65% compared to 2018."
75,0.9957,0.113,0.855,0.032,"Forget General Motors and Ford -- electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has another competitor to contend with: Rivian, the electric truck start-up.

The Detroit-based company is vying with Tesla in the race to bring electric trucks and SUVs to the market.

It has big backers that should worry Tesla. Just this month it raised $350 million in venture funding from Cox Automotive. As part of the deal, both companies will explore ways to team up, including in logistics and digital retailing.

Cox Automotive is just the latest to invest in a company that has already developed two electric adventure vehicles, the R1T truck and R1s SUV. Earlier this year, Rivian raised $700 million in funding led by Amazon, and in April, Ford invested $500 million in the company. With the investment from Cox, Rivian remains independent, but Cox Automotive gets a seat on the board.

The truck market in the U.S. is booming

Going after the U.S. truck market makes a lot of sense for traditional automobile makers and their electric-vehicle rivals, given the strong growth in that category. According to J.D. Power, 71% of new vehicles purchased are trucks, SUVs, or crossovers, leaving cars with just 30% of the market share. These trucks and SUVs typically cost more than their passenger-vehicle counterparts, which means higher average selling prices and better margins for the truck makers.

That hasn't been lost on Tesla. For months, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been teasing the upcoming pickup truck on Twitter, describing the design as ""cyberpunk."" Musk said it should be ready for purchase in November and priced at no more than $49,000. ""We don't want it to be expensive,"" Musk said in a recent podcast. ""It's got to stop at $49K or less.""

Rivian has already developed two electric trucks geared more toward the true off-roader. The vehicles come with a hefty price tag of $69,000 for the truck and $61,000 for the SUV -- and that's after a Federal tax credit. The R1T and the R1s pack a lot of technology and high-end features inside and out. Both Rivian and Tesla's trucks will get at least 400 miles on a single battery charge. Rivian's trucks are expected to hit the market in late 2020; the company has been accepting pre-orders with a refundable deposit of $1,000 since November.

First to market could be the winner

Whoever enters the market first could have a lot of staying power, granted the electric trucks are capable of delivering on its promises. Rewind a few years, and the idea of a low-emissions truck, let alone an electric one, wasn't even a consideration. But with advances in technology and increased urgency on the part of consumers to save the planet, electric cars and now trucks are becoming a reality.

If experience is the basis for determining who will be the winner, Tesla has the edge over Rivian. It has been making and selling electric vehicles for years and has become a leader in the industry. For the first half of 2019, new electric-vehicle sales in California, the biggest market for electric and hybrid vehicles, increased 63.7% with 51,750 electric cars sold. Most of the growth was thanks to Tesla. It's Model 3s accounted for 33,000 of that total. The Chevrolet Bolt EV was a distant second with 4,482 vehicles sold. The Tesla Model X and the Tesla Model S were in third and fourth place, with the Nissan Leaf rounding out the top five electric vehicles. Tesla is the undisputed leader in the electric vehicle car market, commanding about 80% market share in the U.S.

Tesla may have the experience, but it's also prone to missteps. Tesla investors haven't forgotten the production delays and snafus that plagued the Model S, Model X, and Model 3. Any production missteps with its electric truck could lead to costly delays, not to mention pave the way for Rivian to steal its thunder. It doesn't help that Rivian has a lot of cash in its coffers and big-name backers including Amazon."
76,0.9894,0.118,0.813,0.069,"It's easier to win a game when you're playing without an opponent. And that's largely the position Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has found itself in, particularly in the U.S. market. Early rivals in the all-electric vehicle contest such as General Motors ' Chevy Bolt and the Nissan Leaf were smaller and, frankly, not as cool.

But new all-electric offerings from Porsche (OTC:POAH.Y) and a Mustang-inspired crossover SUV from Ford were cause for concern. It might be easy for an ultra-cool Tesla to stomp a subcompact hatchback, but could the Model S and Model 3 hold their own against a classic German luxury brand or an American icon?

Early signs suggest that, yes, it might be able to do just that.

First in the ring

The first car that was getting hyped while in development as a potential ""Tesla killer"" has been unveiled: the Porsche Taycan. In August, it set an unofficial electric car track record on Germany's 16.12-mile Nuerburgring racetrack of 7 minutes, 42 seconds. And when a photo emerged of a Taycan driving past a broken-down Tesla Model S prototype -- which had also come to try its luck on the famed track -- it seemed like it might prove stiff competition.

However, in September, the Model S ""Plaid"" prototype version set a new electric-car Nuerburgring record of its own at 7 minutes, 23 seconds, beating the Taycan by nearly 20 seconds. Now, there are a bunch of caveats to these times, not the least of which is that these were both prototype vehicles, and there's more to a car than how fast it can go. In terms of raw performance, though, Tesla's no pushover.

In terms of range, too, the Model S seems to outperform its German rival. The U.S. EPA states that a Tesla Model S ""Long Range"" (the base model) has a range of 370 miles. A European rating system, the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WTLP), credits the Taycan with a range of just 279 miles, according to Porsche. Though this isn't precisely an apples-to-apples comparison, it looks like the Taycan won't have the range of a Model S either.

Most importantly for consumers, the Taycan's base model -- the Turbo -- starts at a jaw-dropping $150,900 in the U.S. (it's still a Porsche, after all). That's nearly twice as expensive as the base model of the Model S (currently retailing at $79,990). Even in the world of luxury automobiles, that's a price difference large enough to deter many buyers. The Taycan seems unlikely to eat into Tesla's sales in a significant way.

Up for (re)sale

List prices for cars can only tell you so much. A better measure of the value of a brand is what the cars can command at resale. Generally speaking, the more desirable the vehicle, the higher the price a used one can command.

That's certainly been true in the U.S. for Tesla, where the Tesla Model S has retained a greater percentage of its value than other cars in its class, according to a study by Autolist. The study indicates that a used Model X with more than 50,000 miles on it will lose, on average, 23% of its value. The Model S fares only a bit worse, losing 27% of its value (the Model 3 is still too new to get enough data on resales). Meanwhile, gas-powered vehicles lose an average of about 36% of their value after 50,000 miles.

Now we have evidence that Tesla also outperforms other electric carmakers on this front, thanks to a new report about the Chinese electric vehicle resale market, from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. There are numerous non-Tesla electrics available in China, including Roewe's ERX5 SUV and the Denza 500 sedan. Denza is a joint venture between Daimler 's Mercedes and Chinese automaker BYD.

In China, used Teslas are absolutely crushing the competition in terms of value retention, only losing between 23.8% (Model X) and 25.9% (Model S) of their value when used, compared to 52.6% for the ERX5 and 54.1% for the Denza, the closest competitors.

Now, it's possible that this is due to Teslas' perceived superior battery life. But perceived outperformance is a component of brand strength, and the data here seems to indicate that Tesla's brand can hold its own and then some against other EV manufacturers.

Danger comes from within

None of this is proof positive that competition won't hurt Tesla's sales. With so many of the world's largest automakers eyeing the electric vehicle space, it's probably only a matter of time before one of them hits upon a winning formula for a full-size, high-performing vehicle at an attractive price. However, at the moment, there doesn't seem to be much danger of a competing ""Tesla killer"" vehicle knocking it off its pedestal.

That said, there are plenty of other concerns for Tesla and its investors, among them the company's lack of consistent profitability, and margin contraction as the cheaper Model 3 outsells the more expensive Model S and Model X. Unless management can solve those internal problems, the ""Tesla killer"" could turn out to be Tesla itself."
77,0.9955,0.157,0.79,0.052,"With growth stocks getting slammed left and right over the last few weeks, one has to ask: Have some been oversold? Programmatic ad-buying platform The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) and electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are two stocks that are looking particularly compelling after their recent sell-offs.

There's no guarantee either stock will soar in the coming years. But The Trade Desk and Tesla both appear to have underlying business momentum that could potentially support significant share price appreciation. Of course, in order for this to happen, both companies will need their current tailwinds to persist and their management teams to execute shrewdly.

Here's a look at both companies.

The Trade Desk

Shares of The Trade Desk have been hammered recently. The stock is down 27% in the last two months. But its underlying business continues to see strong growth. In the company's second quarter, revenue rose 42% year over year as major global advertisers continued to shift more advertising dollars to programmatic.

Key growth drivers for the company's business include increased ad spend in mobile video, mobile in-app, connected TV (CTV), and audio channels. All of these channels saw ad spend rise 50% year over year or more in Q2, with CTV and audio ad spend rising 150% and 270%, respectively.

But what's particularly attractive about The Trade Desk is that this growth stock is already reporting significant profits -- and these profits are growing rapidly. For the six-month period ending June 30, net income was $38 million, up from $28 million in the first half of 2018. Non-GAAP (adjusted) net income increased from $43 million to $69 million over the same period.

Highlighting its momentum, The Trade Desk lifted its full-year view for revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) when it reported its second-quarter results. Management now expects 2019 revenue to be ""at least"" $653 million, up from a previous forecast for $645 million or more. It expects adjusted EBITDA of $201 million (about 30.8% of revenue), up from $188.5 million (about 29% of revenue).

Tesla

Unlike The Trade Desk, Tesla isn't consistently profitable, but its gross profit is growing quickly and its losses are narrowing as revenue soars. In addition, the automaker's uncanny growth in vehicle sales suggests the company is positioned at the epicenter of growing consumer interest in fully electric vehicles.

Fueled by the success of its Model 3, Tesla's vehicle unit sales jumped 134% year over year in Q2 -- and this growth wasn't isolated to just one quarter. Over the trailing 12 months, vehicle sales climbed 163% year over year.

Meanwhile, the company's financials have improved significantly. Tesla's trailing-12-month gross profit is $4.5 billion, compared to to $4.0 billion in 2018 and $2.2 billion in 2017. Tesla's trailing-12-month net loss was $659 million, an improvement from losses of $976 million and 2.0 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The company's progress is particularly impressive on its cash flow statement, where trailing-12-month free cash flow is positive $1.4 billion, up from negative $222 million in 2018 and negative $4.1 billion in 2017.

The company expects further improvement in its financials throughout the remainder of 2019. Guiding for total deliveries to rise 45% to 65% year over year, management believes this sales growth will enable Tesla to fund its business with its own cash from operations going forward. Further, it expects to be profitable on a GAAP basis in Q3 and beyond.

With Tesla stock down 33% year to date, shares may be oversold."
78,0.9987,0.147,0.837,0.016,"With the electric vehicle (EV) revolution gaining traction as more and more auto giants are stepping into the EV market space, Tesla ’s (TSLA - Free Report) Model 3 is emerging as one of the best-selling EVs, especially in European markets.

Tesla Banking Big on Electric Car Revolution

There has been a sweeping shift in the vehicle industry from internal combustion engines to electric-powered versions. A host of factors such as pollution issues, government sops, cost advantages, stricter fuel emission standards, technical superiority, and increasing adoption from both automakers and customers have turned the fortunes in favor of EVs.

Although electric cars occupy a small portion of the global automobile market, Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within this niche segment. With Model 3 sedan being its flagship vehicle, Tesla has established itself as a leader in the EV segment.

Notably, global electric car sales dropped for the first time on record in July after China dialed back purchase subsidies. Sales in North America also took a hit. While sales of Tesla Model 3 have not been so robust in the United States and China, the electric vehicle market is certainly gaining momentum in Europe.

Since the launch of Model 3 in Europe early this year, rising deliveries have been boosting Tesla’s sales in the continent. The Tesla Model 3 is in a class of its own with superior features, advanced technologies, and speed and safety advantages compared with other brands, making it a highly popular vehicle in several markets.

Model 3 Popularity Skyrockets in Europe

Tesla’s (TSLA - Free Report) Model 3 has become the hot-selling car in Netherlands, with year-to-date sales crossing 10,000 units. Undeniably, this figure is massive. This seems to be an impressive feat for a model that started delivery since February 2019. Not many vehicles manage to sell this much even in a year. Reportedly, Model 3 was the third best-selling vehicle in the country in the January-August period, just behind Volkswagen’s (VWAGY - Free Report) Polo and Ford’s (F - Free Report) Focus. Nevertheless, with a surge in deliveries in September, Model 3 is currently the most popular vehicle in the country this year. Markedly, the country’s sales of EV vehicles are leading in the European market, only outperformed by Norway.

In the Norwegian market, Tesla Model 3 is the hottest-selling car, that too by a large margin. With around 12,000 units sold in Norway so far this year, Tesla’s Model 3 sales have been more than double than Volkswagen Golf, which is in the second spot.

Notably, Netherlands and Norway have always been a big market for Tesla, even before Model 3 hit the roads. But with the launch of Model 3, Norway and Netherlands are much ahead in the EV game in Europe. With the two countries strongly in favor of the wave toward cleaner energy and greener roads, other European nations are following the suit.

Other European countries like Austria, Belgium, Spain and Italy are also catching up, with more Tesla cars in traffic. While these countries have sold only a few hundred Tesla model X and Model S cars per year over the past few years, they are now witnessing a significant surge in deliveries, with the advent of Model 3. This not just underscores the growing electric revolution, especially in Europe, but also reflects the immense popularity of Tesla cars, particularly Model 3. Tesla sales in the United Kingdom and Germany have also been soaring. Tesla is also dominating the Switzerland market with the launch of Model 3.

It is yet to be seen whether Tesla Model 3 manages to maintain its amazing run in the European market. With the continent targeting to sell at least 1,000,000 EVs in 2020, we believe Tesla’s Model 3 sales should continue soaring as fossil fuel vehicle sales are on a decline.

Will Strong Model 3 Sales Help Tesla Offset Woes?

While Tesla Model 3’s success is remarkable, the company is facing a number of challenges including high costs, stretched balance sheet and cash flow crunch, which are hurting its share performance. With China being the biggest EV market, the country’s economic slowdown is likely to weigh on the company’s prospects.

However, Europe is turning out to be a major market for Tesla. Increasing demand of Model 3 in European markets is likely to offset the firm’s weakness in China. Reportedly, EV sales in the European market increased 34% on a year-to-date basis and the trend is likely to continue, boosting Tesla’s sales. Tesla’s Model 3 production ramp up in China at the Gigafactory 3 plant, production of Model Y and ramp-up in credits from the Fiat Chrysler (FCAU - Free Report) deal are also likely to aid the company to achieve profitable goals.

In light of such factors, we believe that the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company — which carries a growth Score of A — is likely to tide over the challenges and return to profitability in the medium to long term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

79,0.2933,0.077,0.846,0.077,"Major benchmarks gave up ground on Tuesday amid investor pessimism about geopolitical conditions. Between possible impeachment proceedings and the potential for new escalation in trade disputes between the U.S. and China, market participants were in no hurry to send indexes toward their old all-time highs. Adding to the gloom was bad news from some key individual companies. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) were among the worst performers. Here's why they did so poorly.

BlackBerry takes a hit

Shares of BlackBerry plunged nearly 23% after the mobile device pioneer reported its second-quarter financial results. In some ways, BlackBerry looked strong, with adjusted revenue climbing 22% and break-even earnings results that were better than many had expected. Yet it also warned that revenue growth wouldn't be as strong going forward as previously expected. Despite positive comments from CEO John Chen, many seem worried that the tech company won't be able to produce success merely by concentrating on the software and services offerings that make up nearly all of its revenue currently.

Tesla deals with controversy

Elsewhere, Tesla stock fell 7.5%. A set of Tesla shareholders filed suit against the company, alleging through derivative shareholder action that Tesla's board breached its fiduciary duties by approving the acquisition of solar specialist SolarCity. CEO Elon Musk was criticized for allegedly supporting the purchase, which some saw as a convenient bailout that was well-timed to help save the failing solar installer. At this point, Tesla investors pay far more attention to its core electric vehicle business than to the acquired SolarCity operations. However, for a company that's seen plenty of controversy in the past, one more issue to deal with is far from welcome.

Lyft helps its rivals

Finally, shares of Lyft finished down almost 8%. The ride-hailing company made a concession to some of its critics, deciding to change its app to include alternative modes of transportation beyond Lyft vehicles. The new app will include bike-sharing, rental cars, and public transportation, and allow users to compare costs across those options. It'll take until early next year to integrate all of this information into the app, but investors already fear that the move will detract from the value of the Lyft network and eventually adversely affect how much the company is able to make in revenue and profit."
80,0.4767,0.061,0.89,0.049,"What happened

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) took a hit on Monday. The stock fell nearly 8% by 2:06 p.m. EDT

The decline follows a report from Reuters that alleged Tesla CEO Elon Musk was aware of financial troubles at SolarCity before he made a case to investors to approve an acquisition of the company.

So what

Musk ""urged investors to approve the 2016 purchase of SolarCity at a big premium to its market value despite knowing the solar installer faced a cash crunch and publicly stating he had recused himself from involvement in the deal, according to court documents unsealed on Monday,"" Reuters wrote this week.

The allegations were brought to light in a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders, which alleged that the automaker breached fiduciary responsibilities to investors when it approved the acquisition of SolarCity at a $2.6 billion price tag.

Of course, some of the stock's pullback on Tuesday is likely the result of a broader-market sell-off of growth stocks. Many mega- and large-cap growth stocks are trading at least several percentage points lower on Tuesday.

Now what

Tesla investors should keep an eye on this developing story. A negative outcome in this lawsuit could taint investors' view of Musk and Tesla's board.

On the other hand, investors should keep in mind that Tesla's solar business is a very small part of the company's total operations. It will likely be the automaker's performance in electric vehicles that will make or break the stock's long-term performance, not its solar business."
81,-0.1793,0.072,0.852,0.076,"The stock market looked ugly on Tuesday afternoon, with the major indices registering steep declines in the wake of President Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations.

Data source: Yahoo! Finance.

Heading lower along with the market were Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). The electric-car maker was hit by new lawsuit details that painted a disturbing picture, while shares of the streaming-device company continued their multiweek collapse.

Tesla lawsuit details emerge

Shares of electric car manufacturer Tesla were down 6.8% at 12:50 p.m. EDT Tuesday. While the stock is normally volatile, the decline may be partly due to developments in the lawsuit regarding Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity.

Court documents unsealed on Monday revealed the arguments against the company. The documents claim that Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed investors to approve the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016 at a large premium, even though he had ostensibly recused himself from being involved in the deal. Musk was also aware that SolarCity was facing a cash crunch, according to the filing.

The filing also claims that SolarCity was insolvent soon after the closing of the $2.6 billion deal. The acquisition was proposed by Musk despite SolarCity telling its board of directors in early 2016 that its cash balances were expected to drop below a level required for a line of credit, according to the filing.

The acquisition of SolarCity has not worked out well for Tesla. At the time of the deal, SolarCity was the largest residential solar installer in the U.S. Since then, the pace of installations has plunged as the company moved to an online sales model.

With Tesla still posting big losses as the auto industry girds for a downturn, this lawsuit is the last thing the company needs.

Roku's collapse continues

Rapid-fire revenue growth turned Roku stock into a rocket ship this year. Shares soared from around $30 in early 2019 to a high of around $170 earlier this month. At its peak, Roku was worth close to $20 billion.

In the past few weeks, that euphoria has vanished. Including Tuesday's slump, Roku stock is down nearly 40% since early September. This has truly been a case of taking the stairs up, and the elevator down: By 12:50 p.m. EDT Tuesday, shares of Roku were down 4% on the day.

Even after crashing over the past few weeks, Roku remains an expensive stock. Based on the midpoint of the company's full-year revenue guidance range, shares are currently trading for 11 times sales. Roku expects to post a net loss this year.

Roku's hardware is popular, and revenue from its platform is growing at a breakneck pace. But judging by the stock's performance this month, the valuation got way out ahead of the fundamentals. And with Roku still priced for perfection, the pain may just be getting started."
82,0.999,0.152,0.816,0.032,"Owning companies that grow much faster than the economy over the long term can be one of the best ways to beat the market. Investors often have a hard time valuing a company that grows five times or more in the course of a decade, but hindsight can make those stocks look cheap if they hit high growth numbers.

Four companies that are among the market's leaders in growth are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and Square (NYSE:SQ), and they all still have a lot of growth ahead.

Facebook is still a growth machine

It's hard to overstate how powerful Facebook has become -- not only in people's lives, but for businesses trying to reach customers. Running a Facebook page and Instagram account are two of the best ways to interact with customers and reach a wider audience. And it's the value Facebook offers to businesses that's the real moneymaker: $16.6 billion of Facebook's $16.9 billion of revenue in the second quarter of 2019 came from advertising.

As fast as Facebook is growing in the U.S. (nearly doubling revenue in the past two years), what's incredible is how much growth potential it has internationally -- 48% of the company's revenue comes from the U.S. and Canada, but just 10% of its monthly active users live there.

Not only can Facebook grow its core business internationally, I also don't think we're done seeing it grow its business units. The company's marketplace function is a huge success, and it's rolling out a dating platform, too. With 2.4 billion monthly active users worldwide, there are many more ways it can engage users and continue growing.

The future of automobiles

There's a lot of debate in the market about whether Tesla's business is sustainable long term, but there's no question that it's been a growth machine. The company has generated $24.9 billion of revenue in the past year and has obliterated every other auto manufacturer in electric vehicles.

I don't have any doubt that Tesla will continue to grow; the question is at what cost? Its operating margin is just 1.3% over the past year, and it's seeing its solar business shrink into oblivion, losing a once-promising channel to build a larger sales organization and product ecosystem.

If Tesla can stay a few steps ahead of the competition in EVs, it'll continue to command the market's respect. But that will be harder to do in the future. Competition is heating up with Porsche, Nissan, Volkswagen, and more companies introducing new EV models in the next year, so all eyes will be on whether or not Tesla can keep sales momentum going and push margins higher with real competition in the EV space.

The growth stock in retail

You can see in the chart above that Shopify has grown revenue by nearly 10 times over the last five years, an amazing feat for any company. The genius of Shopify is that it's providing tools that make building an e-commerce business easy, and that's a booming category today. The platform provides an online store, a point-of-sale (POS) system on- and offline, social media tools, and even simple shipping tools that can be indispensable to new companies.

E-commerce companies today don't want to be experts in building a website or logistics, they want to focus on building a brand and creating products people want. For a modest fee, Shopify handles a lot of the rest of the tools needed to run a business so management can spend time on adding value, rather than thinking about details that can distract entrepreneurs from more important aspects of their businesses. Given the tools Shopify is adding to make building an e-commerce site more easily, I don't see any competitor catching up soon, which bodes well for its long-term growth.

Another online payment tool

Square is a little like Shopify's older brother, offering some of the same tools but with some different end markets in mind. Square's bread-and-butter customers are salons and food-truck-type businesses, which want an easy-to-use payment solution on the go. Some of them use tools like scheduling, payroll, and even capital services. But the initial pitch to these operators was a simple 2.9% fee for every swipe. No need to set up merchant accounts or deal with payment processors -- Square was one-stop shopping.

Today, it has built out a portfolio that you could use to run a restaurant or bakery, power a retail shop, or operate virtually any other business. Its back-end tools make it a valuable ecosystem of products that tie together complex systems smoothly.

What I like about Square's position today is that it's building a suite of offerings that aren't likely to be matched by another company anytime soon. The POS device is the center of the offering, but for a fee, customers can add dozens of services that work seamlessly with the POS system. And the more services customers use, the stickier this business is, which will keep Square growing for a long time.

4 great ways to bet on growth

83,0.9994,0.214,0.77,0.015,"Energy storage is becoming a hot product in corporate energy procurement, with everything from solar paired with energy storage to stand-alone storage systems on companies' wish lists. The market is still small, but it's growing quickly, and as companies consider their procurement plans for the future, we should see more growth in 2019 and beyond.

As much as energy storage may be important for making large amounts of renewable energy work effectively in the grid, the reason companies are investing in energy storage is all about the bottom line. There's real financial justification for energy storage, and that's what keeps the business going.

How energy storage makes money

Energy assets like energy storage need to make financial sense before companies deploy them at scale, and it's not a slam-dunk that energy storage meets the minimum return on investment. Still, there are a few ways energy storage can make financial sense both through cost savings and revenue from the battery's value to the grid:

Demand charges can be up to half of a commercial building's energy cost and are based on the peak amount of electricity demand going to the building. So, a big spike in demand for 15 minutes for one hour a month can mean thousands of dollars in added costs. Energy storage can help reduce those peak demand numbers and therefore save customers money.
Virtual power plants are a relatively new concept in energy, and what they're essentially trying to do is band a group of energy storage assets together to act like a much larger power plant. When they work together, they can offset the need for expensive peaker plant power by using up cheaper electrons generated in off-peak hours. Utilities are starting to pay companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), and Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) for their virtual power plants, adding value to the energy storage they put into buildings.
Backup power is a more intangible benefit, but companies who rely on electricity to keep operations going definitely put a premium on having a quality backup, which energy storage is perfect for.

These aren't the only ways energy storage can add value to companies or the grid, but they show the biggest selling points. When corporations are looking at their energy needs, energy storage can be a lot more appealing when you consider the cost savings, revenue potential, and value in backup power.

Who's making money off energy storage?

How do investors capitalize on the energy storage growth trend? Battery makers are in a tough position because they are in a commodity business and rarely develop energy storage projects themselves. LG Chem (NASDAQOTH: LGCLF) is one of the largest battery manufacturers for energy storage, but it still only holds a fraction of the market. And it relies on third parties to install and control the energy storage system.

In the commercial market, SunPower is the biggest name in solar, and it's adding energy storage to about 30% of its commercial solar installations. As the cost of batteries comes down, I expect the level of energy storage penetration to go up and SunPower to be able to find more ways to monetize its energy storage installations, which are often built on the company's balance sheet.

Tesla is another leader in energy storage and may be playing more of a supply role than SunPower. It's the battery manufacturer at the Gigafactory, and it's selling Powerpacks to commercial buildings, often through projects developed by someone else. But it has the scale to make this a very big business going forward.

Most of the other companies in energy storage are private, like Stem and Sonnen, who have built large energy storage businesses. But they haven't hit public markets, and we don't yet know if they're making money on commercial energy storage.

The size of the energy storage market

In the U.S., energy storage installations were 311 MW and 777 megawatt-hours in 2018, up from virtually nothing just six years ago. About a third of the installations so far in 2018 are commercial storage projects, and the segment has shown more stable installation trends than residential or utility-scale storage.

Still, the industry is just getting started, and Wood Mackenzie and the Energy Storage Association's analysts expect total MW hours deployed to grow nearly 14 times in the next five years. Commercial energy storage will be a big piece of that growth, so you can see why companies are so excited about it."

Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

This week, Tracey is joined by David Bartosiak, Zacks Equity Strategist and Editor of Zacks Surprise Trader portfolio, to talk about the auto industry and auto stocks.

For the last several years, the worry about the auto industry has been “peak auto” which meant “peak earnings.”

Collectible Cars and Recessions

But several other auto “signals” have also been giving investors pause, including the results of the auctions at 2019’s Monterey Car Week.

Monterey is a classic car show and auction held every year in California which features some of the world’s most expensive car auctions.

Total sales at this year’s event were down double digits from last year with sales of cars over $1 million being hit the hardest.

Other slow sales in the past have been 2000 through 2003 and 2008 through 2009, both time periods, not surprisingly, where the economy was in contraction.

Usually collectibles, whether art, baseball cards or cars, see a decline in value during a recession as they aren’t a necessity.

But the US economy currently isn’t in a recession, so what gives?

Auto Stocks Are Cheap, Should You Buy?

On the other end of the car industry are the new car manufacturers.

Peak auto has been the worry for the last several years as auto sales in North America hit a record but haven’t climbed further.

Additionally, now China is struggling as new car sales there have fallen for 14 months.

Still, some of the auto stocks trade with single digit P/Es.

Is this a buying opportunity?

5 Auto Stocks to Consider

1. General Motors (GM - Free Report) has a forward P/E of just 5.5 even though shares are up 14.5% this year. Yet, workers have recently gone on strike which will put uncertainty into the shares. Shareholders are getting a dividend yielding 4.1% for their patience. Is this a value or a trap?

2. Ford Motor Company (F - Free Report) is also extremely cheap with a forward P/E of 7.2. It has also rallied this year, adding 21%. But even still, it is paying a dividend yielding 6.5%. Is there any earnings growth expected going into next year?

3. Toyota Motor Corp. (TM - Free Report) has risen 18% year-to-date and still trades with a forward P/E of just 9.2. It also pays a dividend but it’s the lowest of the three at “just” 2.6%. Is it a value or a trap?

4. Ferrari N.V. (RACE - Free Report) has been the hottest of the auto maker stocks this year, as shares have jumped 55%. But over the last 3 months, they’re up just 0.2% as the rally has stalled. It’s not as cheap, on a P/E level, at 37x. But does the growth justify the price?

5. Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is the only one of the five whose shares have fallen this year. They’re down 26.5% year-to-date. There’s still no P/E yet as analysts expect another year of losses in 2019. But with shares on the decline, is this a buying opportunity or a trap?

85,0.9973,0.118,0.846,0.036,"Customers have proven over and over again that they aren't particularly interested in paying cash for solar installations for their roofs and don't want to go to the work of keep track of energy assets like energy storage in the home. But if the financing package and services are right and savings are real, they are willing to sign long-term deals to buy energy from their roof as more of a service.

This opens up the potential for a larger list of energy a service offerings for solar for customers. Pair solar with energy storage, demand response, and EV charging, and it may be the start of a real transition to renewable energy for millions of people.

Start with what customers understand

For starters, all energy companies need to know what customers will understand and pay for. They've proven the ability to understand the monthly payment of a solar lease or power purchase agreement (PPA). These business models are simpler than a purchase or loan because the installer takes on the rebates and tax incentives that can be confusing for customers to use. Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) and Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR) are the two biggest residential solar installers, and power purchase agreements or leases dominate their business today.

Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) new solar rental brings that simplicity to another level with payments of as little as $50 per month for a solar installation. No ups and downs for seasonality; it's a constant payment all year because that's what customers understand.

As companies have tried to add services to PPAs and leases, alterations and added system complexity have been the biggest barrier. Customers have struggled to understand why they should pay for energy storage or how demand response works (the ability to adjust a home's energy demand, like turning off the A/C, when grid demand is high), so any service needs to bring these products together in an easy-to-understand package. To begin with, we know that customers understand a monthly payment for energy and that's where companies need to start their sales pitch. If they can include components and services as part of that monthly payment that bring in new revenue streams from the utility, then it could put the solar installer at the center of your energy experience at home.

What solar companies can offer

Solar companies can now offer a suite of products beyond just solar panels on the roof where the revenue is a monthly payment from customers. Energy storage can store energy from one time of day and use it at another, demand response can control a home's energy usage at peak price hours, and EVs are now a source of demand that can be charged at optimal times. Utilities are willing to pay for services these assets can offer as we've seen with virtual power plants bidding into capacity markets. And those added components are where solar companies start playing a much bigger role in a homeowner's energy service with multiple ways to monetize the assets.

The inverter and energy storage system would really be the brains of the operation for any solar-as-a-service offering. It would be the buffer between the solar system, home demand, and utility. It'll control what devices can be turned on and off by demand response and where it's most cost-effective to get energy from at any given time (solar on the roof or the grid). The advantage of having a smart energy storage system is that it can use signals from the utility to optimize electricity usage in the home.

The big change over the last few years is that energy storage could also help optimize the grid itself. Companies like Tesla, Sunrun, and SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) are starting to sell energy storage as a service to the grid in competitive markets, and they'll use energy storage systems in the home to provide value for the grid that utilities will pay for. Similarly, demand response can be bid into energy markets, so multiple services could be sold to grid operators from a customers' home. For the customer, this service to the grid would be nearly invisible, but the solar-as-a-service provider would be providing a service to both homeowners and utilities that both parties would be willing to pay for.

Why utilities might buy-in

If homeowners are providing a service to utilities, the utility will clearly want a seat at the table. That may be in the form of offload agreements with an energy storage aggregator like SunPower or Tesla, but it may also be with the utility playing a role in setting customers up with solar and energy storage. SunPower piloted a program similar to this with Con Edison (NYSE:ED) three years ago, and it may offer value to both parties. If the utility is the sales arm, it could help lower the sales and marketing costs that have plagued residential solar companies for years, and solar companies would be willing to pay utilities for those sales leads.

Installing more distributed assets would allow utilities and regulators to reduce the money that needs to be invested in new transmission, distribution, and power plants. This would make for a smarter and potentially much cheaper grid overall, which could be a win for all parties.

The companies to watch in solar as a service

Only a handful of companies have the scale and business model to aggregate enough energy services to provide a viable product to homeowners and utilities. Sunrun, Vivint Solar, and SunPower are the three leaders in the industry, and they're the ones I would look to first. They're already offering solar services to customers and building virtual power plant networks to offer service to utilities, so they're ahead of the curve.

Tesla would seem to have a natural product lineup for energy as a service with EVs, the Powerwall, and solar, but its solar business is shrinking and doesn't have the scale of the first three. It'll be a big battery supplier to utilities, but residential solar is no longer its bread and butter.

If solar companies are able to get energy as a service right, they may finally have the simple product offering that consumers want and the services that utilities need to build a cleaner energy future."
86,0.9986,0.142,0.824,0.033,"Tesla’s (TSLA - Free Report) impressive lineup of electric vehicles (EVs) is built from the ground up, which means the company has had a longer learning cycle. It follows then that there aren’t any standby parts from a regular business that can quickly fill gaps in the supply chain. And yet, it seems pretty well positioned as the world moves toward greener mobility.

That’s because the biggest challenge for EV adoption isn’t the parts, but the supporting infrastructure that isn’t quite there yet. So battery production and charging stations just aren’t keeping up with the number of EVs taking to the roads. And many more are slated to hit the market by 2021, when the EU deadline for a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions kicks in.

The EU wants to reduce emissions by another 37.5% between 2021 and 2030. Failure to comply will lead to a combined 33 billion euros in fines, estimate analysts at Evercore ISI, much higher than the estimated compliance cost of 15.3 billion euros.

So it’s something of a competitive advantage for Tesla that its cars can run longer than anything out there (325 miles for the long-range Model X and 310 miles for the long-range Model S, while the competition is yet to touch 300 miles).

Tesla also has another advantage. While traditional automakers can dip into their parts supply, they also have to fund ever more expensive exhaust treatment for their internal combustion engine (ICE)-driven lineup, while continuing R&D investment in EVs. Tesla doesn’t have to deal with that. It can simply focus on ramping up production and getting more capacity on line.

Then there’s the question of demand. Tesla’s sexy models have wowed the public and despite the issues that users have at times faced, Tesla still has a hard time meeting demand. And all the credit doesn’t go to the company. The U.S. government’s incentives to buyers have gone a long way toward creating this demand. Whereas, in places like the EU, there’s still no consensus among member nations about what could be the amount of such an incentive for buyers.

Add to that the complexity of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, Britain’s likely departure from the EU without a deal in place, and slowing growth across the world, which are in combination impacting buying decisions.

All things considered, it isn’t too surprising that the Frankfurt Motor Show, organized by the German Association of the Automotive Industry, lacks some of the spark that it has in the past. Automakers are concerned that the cost of setting up at the show wouldn’t generate sufficient sales (more than half of the 810,400 attendees at the last show said they were planning on buying a new car within the next six months).

Automakers are also finding easier ways of reaching the public, such as by web-streaming vehicle launches and holding their own exclusive events.

So 30 big automakers, including Fiat Alfa Romeo, Nissan, Toyota, Aston Martin, Peugeot Citroen, Fiat, Jeep, Mitsubishi and Nissan and Toyota are skipping the show altogether.

JATO Dynamics estimates that just 1.8% of cars sold in Europe are EVs today. Bernstein estimates that unit sales will go to 400,000 in 2021, or 2.6% of the 15 million cars sold annually.

The trade tensions with the U.S. and regulation-driven demand in the EU are playing into the hands of Chinese manufacturers and suppliers whose numbers swelled from 79 in 2017 to 79 this year (overall exhibitors dropped from 994 in 2017 to 800 this year). Chinese companies Byton and Great Wall Motor are particularly positive about their prospects in the region.

Volkswagen, Audi, Honda, Hyundai, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz accounted for the biggest EV announcements. Porsche made waves at the high end with its sexy Taycan, which including taxes, will cost $152,000 in the U.S. This was the only design, according to reviewers that was comparable with Tesla’s Model 3.

Conclusion

The auto industry across the world isn’t in a particularly good condition right now because of a multitude of factors on both demand and supply sides, as well as on the regulatory front. With environmental considerations topmost on regulators’ minds, Tesla and Elon Musk, despite all the histrionics, seem best prepared for the new paradigm, them and a host of Chinese players.

Recommendation

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 5.2% as of 3:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday. The gain was Tesla's biggest jump in seven weeks, according to MarketWatch.

Though there wasn't any news on Wednesday material enough to justify such a sharp gain in the automaker's stock price, Tesla shares have notably seen a clear positive upward trend recently. This is likely an extension of this trend.

So what

Including Wednesday's gain, Tesla shares have risen 17% since Aug. 23. In addition, the stock is up 12% in the past five days alone.

Some of the stock's rise may reflect sentiment from some investors that shares were oversold in the time period leading up to this rebound. Despite the growth stock 's recent run-up, shares are down 33% from the stock's high of about $366 last year. Further, a combination of soaring revenue and headwinds for the stock price over the last 12 months has meant Tesla's price-to-sales ratio fell from about 3.5 to 1.7. In addition, Tesla has gone from negative free cash flow of $4.1 billion in 2017 to positive free cash flow of $1.4 billion in the trailing-12-month period.

Perhaps investors are now warming up to Tesla stock at this lower valuation, considering this to be a nice entry point.

Now what

While it's interesting to ponder what's behind Tesla's near-term stock movements, investors should remain focused on the electric-car maker's underlying business. Specifically, investors should look for Tesla to continue executing on its ambitious targets for a 45% to 65% year-over-year increase in vehicle sales in 2019 and positive net income in Q3 and beyond."
88,-0.981,0.08,0.801,0.118,"Tesla may be known for churning out eye-appealing green vehicles, but it has found a new market to go after: insurance.

Several months after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk hinted the Palo Alto, California-based company plans to offer customers automobile insurance, it appears to be following through. Last week it announced the launch of Tesla Insurance which it said can save Tesla owners as much as 30% in rates. The insurance provides comprehensive coverage and claims management to Tesla owners in California. The company intends to expand its insurance to additional states down the road. Tesla claims it can offer deeply discounted rates because it is insuring its own vehicles.

""Tesla uniquely understands its vehicles, technology, safety, and repair costs, and eliminates fees taken by traditional insurance carriers,"" it wrote in a blog post. ""By pricing policies to reflect Tesla's active safety and advanced driver assistance features, which come standard on all new Tesla vehicles, Tesla Insurance is able to offer reduced insurance costs for many eligible owners."" Tesla Insurance is currently available to all Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Roadster vehicles.

Tesla's cars are more expensive to insure

Tesla's entrance into the insurance market isn't only about finding a new revenue stream. It's designed to solve a problem that has long plagued the vehicle maker: Tesla cars are more expensive than other types of vehicles to insure. According to ValuePengiun, the average cost of car insurance for a Tesla vehicle is $2,450. That could increase depending on the model, trim, location and driver's history operating a vehicle. Meanwhile last year USA Today named the Tesla Model S four-door electric vehicle as the most expensive vehicle to insure.

Market watchers and customers contend these vehicles require pricier insurance because of the costs to repair them in the event of a collision. They point to the aluminum body of the vehicle, the lack of expertise on the part of Tesla mechanics and auto body repair specialists and replacement part expenses for the higher-than-average repair costs. If Tesla is able to reduce insurance premiums, it could alleviate any complaints when the vehicles need repairs.

Warren Buffett warns Tesla could fail

News that Tesla is getting into the insurance business didn't sit well with everyone, although Tesla vehicle owners will likely rejoice if they can save money. Famed investor and head of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett warned Tesla will likely struggle with its newfound business since car insurance isn't an easy market to enter. ""The success of the auto companies getting into the insurance business is probably as likely as the success of the insurance companies getting into the auto business,"" CNBC quoted him as saying at the annual Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting. Buffett should know. Roughly one-third of Berkshire Hathaway is in the insurance market including its ownership of GEICO.

Critics say selling auto insurance serves as a distraction to a company that has long struggled with manufacturing snafus and missed deadlines. Last month Tesla lost its director of manufacturing quality J. Eric Purcell, who had been at the company for about seven years. He was just the latest in a list of executive departures at the company.

It doesn't help that Tesla vehicles have been the subject of high-profile crashes in recent years. In March a Tesla Model 3 owner died when the vehicle crashed into a semi-truck. It's similar to an accident in 2016 when a Tesla owner crashed into a truck while in autopilot. Earlier Wednesday The National Transportation Safety Board blamed driver errors as well as the autopilot design of the Model S for a crash in January of 2018. In that accident, the vehicle crashed into a fire truck that was parked on a highway in California. There were no casualties in that wreck.

Given it's the early days of offering insurance for Tesla, the jury is still out on whether or not it will give it a recurring stream of revenue to help it achieve profitability that's sustainable. But if there are more accidents like the previous ones to befall Tesla drivers, the cost to pay out claims may end up cannibalizing any gains from its new endeavor."
89,0.9866,0.095,0.875,0.031,"It seems that Elon Musk’s charisma during his recent two-day tour to China has paid off well, as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) won exemption from 10% purchase tax on vehicle sales in China. Reportedly, the tax break was announced the same day Tesla’s enigmatic leader Musk met Chinese Transport Minister Li Xiaopeng. The tax reprieve to one of America’s high-profile company comes as a pleasant surprise amid the escalating U.S.-Sino trade war tiff, wherein Beijing plans to impose 25% tariff on U.S. cars and 5% on auto parts, effective Dec 15, 2019.

The exemption is designed to benefit electric cars, primarily those manufactured in China. According to CNN Business, 34 carmakers were on the exemption list. This mainly applies to cars made by joint ventures between Chinese and foreign firms, like Daimler AG (DDAIF - Free Report) and Toyota Motor (TM - Free Report) . The only foreign manufacturer that was granted an exemption on its own was Tesla.

The tax break will lower the price that customers have to pay for Model 3, Model S or Model X Tesla cars. On an average, the exemption will reduce the cost of buying new Tesla car by 99,000 yuan.

Amid the tit-for-tat tariff fight between the United States and China, along with a decline in the yuan, Tesla had already lifted vehicle prices in China last Friday. The U.S. auto giant is reportedly mulling to hike prices again in December, if China follows through its plans to reimpose 25% tariff on U.S. cars and 5% on auto parts, which it had discontinued in April.

While Tesla has ambitious plans to start production in China, it currently depends on California to produce vehicles for the world's largest car market. Tesla plans to start production in the country, once it completes the Gigafactory 3 plant’s construction in Shanghai. This will be Tesla’s first factory outside the United States and marks the first time China has allowed a foreign carmaker to set up a facility without a local partner.

90,0.9836,0.083,0.842,0.075,"In this week's Industry Focus: Energy, host Nick Sciple chats with analyst Jim Mueller about the latest in the never-ending press spectacle that is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). First, an update on Tesla Insurance. The insurance site went live, and customers were told they might snag rates 20% to 30% lower than the competition. Where is Tesla Insurance getting those 20% to 30% lower numbers? That's unclear, and the website was abruptly closed for an ""algorithm update.""

The story that's been grabbing even more headlines, though, is the solar roofs at Walmart. Nick and Jim talk about why the SolarCity acquisition is turning out to be a big problem for Tesla, how that problem could get even worse in just a few months, where the roof fires fit into it all, and how Tesla could turn this around.

Stay tuned to the end for a ray of hope for the struggling carmaker.

A full transcript follows the video.

Nick Sciple: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, August 29th, and we're discussing Tesla, once again. I'm your host, Nick Sciple, and today I'm joined in studio by Motley Fool analyst Jim Mueller. How's it going, Jim?

Jim Mueller: Hey, Nick! How are you?

Sciple: I'm doing great! It's been a while since we've had you in the studio, Jim. How has life been?

Mueller: It's been well. It's been pretty good. Enjoying the weather here at the end of August, which is a strange thing to say in the D.C. area, but it's actually nice out today.

Sciple: Yeah. Labor Day weekend. I'm heading down to Atlanta for a kickoff college football. Very excited. Last time I had you on the show was a little bit under a year ago. We were talking about the U.S.-China trade war. We were talking about tariffs. We're talking about, when we get into 2019, maybe this will slack off. Any updates on what's going on there, Jim?

Mueller: Yeah, no such luck on the slack off there. It's going fast and furious. The effects are actually beginning to be felt now by U.S. companies and will likely be felt by consumers soon. For instance, Deere lowered the guidance -- the maker of the big farm equipment -- because farmers are not buying the equipment because they're not being able to sell a lot of their crops to China. Qualcomm lowered their guidance recently, as well, because they're a chip supplier into China, where they use the chips to manufacture all kinds of consumer electronics. Importers are dealing with the tariffs in many different ways. They're not raising wages. They're actually passing on prices to consumers. For example, Walmart recently said they're going to have to raise the prices of the stuff they sell in their stores, just in time for Christmas. That's going to make it painful for American consumers. And then, the whole shifting supply chains thing. President Trump urged American businesses to get out of China recently. Companies are already trying to, but after decades of building up China as the manufacturer of the world, and the web that involves the suppliers to the manufacturers and the suppliers to the suppliers, it's not easy to make shifts away from China and find, hopefully, as inexpensive manufacturing, but then, the support infrastructure is not there. It's just a hot mess right now.

Sciple: Yeah. I think literally and figuratively, you could say there are a lot of moving parts here. A lot of things to navigate. It's been tough for folks. Not even [just] in the U.S. Germany has talked about slowing auto markets in China as a result of this. It's hurt their economy. A lot of trickle down issues. Hopefully, it gets resolved. But we're not that different from where we've been a year ago when we were talking about this.

We are talking about Tesla today. The main topic we're going to talk about today is Tesla Solar, which has really been in the news a lot recently. But we did get some more Tesla news last night, which has been interesting. Tesla Insurance launched in California last night. We've been waiting for that product launch since it was first mentioned by Elon Musk and Tesla back in May. It finally launched last night in California. However, three hours later, the product was pulled down for an algorithm update. I checked Tesla's website today -- that's still ongoing. Obviously, things are continuing to play out. But just high-level thoughts on this rollout and what's been going on so far?

Mueller: I don't know what Tesla's experience is in insurance. Are they the ones pricing the insurance? Or do they have another company pricing the insurance for them, and Tesla's just being the front man? It's not really clear, at least not to me. One thing that does concern me is an item that says that Tesla owners will be able to get rates 20%, maybe even 30% cheaper than they could at other insurers. That makes me wonder whether Tesla or the underwriter actually has enough data to justify a lower price like that. Insurance rates are set by data, both by how much it costs to repair the cars, how often the cars get into accidents and have to be totaled, yada yada on that line, as well as the driver him or herself, how often they get into accidents or make claims, and so on. Is there enough data for any underwriter at this point to say, ""Hey, we're going to give you a 20% lower rate because you deserve it and because the data backs us up?"" And it's that ""data backs us up"" part that I'm not too sure about in this situation.

Sciple: Yeah. Obviously, still a developing story. They're doing this algorithm update. We'll see how those rates materialize. But something to watch going forward.

The main topic I want to talk about today, though, is Tesla Solar. In the past week, it's been all over the news. SolarCity, since the 2016 acquisition by Tesla for $6.5 billion, the solar business has flown under the radar. The solar roof has been a lot in the news. Musk will periodically surface and say, ""Hey, we're about to ramp up the solar roof."" But solar has really been brought front and center in recent days following a spate of legal filings and some associated articles. Can you just introduce us to those, Jim, at a high level?

Mueller: The big legal filing that probably hit the news most surprisingly is Walmart filing suit recently, saying that it was, what, 140 roofs that they had?

Sciple: It was over 200 roofs, seven that had fire issues.

Mueller: Seven had fires over the last couple of years, and they could, they felt reasonably secure that they could trace that back to the solar panels that SolarCity had installed. The claim was that SolarCity employees -- that is, Tesla employees -- were not inspecting the roofs on a regular schedule, were not maintaining them as they were required to, and therefore, Walmart believes that Tesla Solar was in breach of contract. And basically, I think they want the solar panels removed, and Walmart reimbursed for the expenses of having to close down the stores, the loss of inventory, the damage, the repairs, and all that stuff.

Sciple: Yeah. This is a dispute that, if you read through the legal filings, has been ongoing going back [to] 2018 and earlier, but finally reached the point where Walmart filed a lawsuit. Obviously, it's a legal filing, but some very aggressive language in there. I think ""utter incompetence"" were the words they'd used. So obviously, this affected the company.

And then, over the top again, this week on Sunday, we got Bethany McLean, very famous for outing the Enron scandal, coming into this Tesla story, publishing an article in Vanity Fair titled ""He's Full of [S**t]: How Elon Musk Fooled Investors, Bilked Taxpayers, and Gambled Tesla to Save SolarCity."" Jim, just another high level, what is McLean talking about in this article?

Mueller: What she's talking about there is that Elon Musk forced through the purchase of SolarCity by Tesla. She's basing her article on reporting by the Buffalo News, especially David Robinson, in that the bailout was basically misleading investors and shareholders who had to vote to approve it. Even though Musk and the Reeve brothers and Kimbal, I believe, all recused themselves from the vote, everyone knew what these guys wanted to happen, so there was pressure for that. There was a big presentation, which launched the idea of the solar roof, and Musk presenting what appeared to be solar roofs already installed on some buildings. Turned out to be just a mockup, installed on the set of, what was it, Desperate Housewives?

Sciple: Yeah. It was the backlot.

Mueller: Backlot film, used in Desperate Housewives. And this was going to be the saving grace of SolarCity. It was going to cause a bunch of cash flow into Tesla, which would be great for the company, and instead has led to all kinds of problems, including debt issues, debt repayments, declining sales of solar panels by SolarCity, halting of their marketing themselves, and going out to the house and doing the inspection themselves. Now, the homeowner is supposed to take pictures and send it to SolarCity to have the product figured out. It's just been going downhill, and it has the potential to really cause some serious problems for Tesla, unfortunately.

Sciple: Sure. The other issue that you mentioned there, as well, is that the business, when they had first acquired the factory, received $750 million in financing from New York State. At the time, Tesla had planned to build 10,000 solar panels per day, create thousands of jobs in Buffalo. As a condition of that funding from New York State. SolarCity, which became part of Tesla, later got a 10-year lease on the property in Buffalo for $1 a year, was tasked with: employing 1,460 high-tech jobs at the factory, another 2,000 in support and sales installation folks, another 1,440 jobs in the state, and pledged to spend $5 billion in New York State over the next decade. However, as Jim mentioned, we've seen installations decline, and they haven't quite hit those job numbers yet.

Mueller: Even the employee numbers. Tesla itself said there were only a few hundred employees in the state and only a fraction of those in Buffalo itself. Then we have Elon Musk coming out and saying, ""Hey, we're ramping up production of the solar roof."" I don't know if he actually said they expect to make 1,000 a week by the end of this year, whether that was an expectation or a hope or whatever, but with only a few hundred employees at this plant in Buffalo, it really doesn't seem as if the company's even going to be able to make that target even if it is making solar roofs today, which is in doubt itself, unfortunately.

Sciple: Yeah. Just to back up, with the SolarCity acquisition, Tesla had acquired a business that had two-thirds of the residential solar market in the U.S. They claimed that it would add more than $500 million dollars to Tesla's balance sheet over the next three years. In reality, what has materialized is that it has drastically increased Tesla's debt position, their market share has declined meaningfully down to 7% of the U.S. residential solar market, their installations have declined about 85% since that date. So as a result, what is Tesla left with after this transaction today?

Mueller: Tesla's left with a business that seems to be in decline and disappearing, actually. Tesla Solar only installed 29 megawatts of panels in the second quarter of this year. That's down from 200 megawatts installed just two years prior in the second quarter of 2016. With the solar roofs not really out there yet, I don't know where SolarCity is going to be able to generate any sort of revenue or cash flow for the company. What that leaves Tesla and Tesla shareholders saddled with is a bunch of debt that Tesla also bought when they bought SolarCity. One of the pieces is coming due on November 1st. It's a $556 million convertible bond. The bond holders have the choice on November 1st of either converting their bonds into shares of Tesla or receiving their cash investment back plus any unpaid interest. Given that the conversion prices are in the $500 to $700 range of Tesla, and where Tesla shares are trading today -- in the low $200 range -- no holder in their right mind of any of those bonds is going to say, ""OK, I don't want my cash. You can keep the cash. Just give me shares of Tesla when I'm asking for something that's worth a third less than what I gave you."" So Tesla's going to have to come up with $556 million plus a little bit of interest and pay that off. If they don't -- and this is an unfortunate consequence of the purchase of SolarCity -- if they don't pay that when it comes due in two months, that can have serious consequences.

If they miss that payment, then other bonds that they have out -- for instance, there's a convertible bond due in March of 2022 that says, ""If you fail to pay off any other mortgage or bond or borrowing worth $150 million or more, then our bond is going to be declared to be in default, and we have the right to accelerate the payment."" And that particular bond, on June 30th, had a balance of $977 million. So if Tesla fails to pay that $556 million, then all of a sudden, they could be asked to pay another $977 million, and then the other bondholders -- there's just this whole cascade effect that could happen if Tesla fails to pay this.

Now, is Tesla going to let that happen? I don't think so. They have to be aware of the covenants of the bonds they've issued. So unless they've already spent -- what did they have, $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet?

Sciple: As of June 31st.

Mueller: As of June 30th. There's no June 31st. [laughs]

Sciple: [laughs] I'm not here for my calendar skills.

Mueller: [laughs] Right. So if they've already spent a good chunk of that money elsewhere, such as paying back suppliers money that they owed their suppliers for the car business, or if they cannot somehow negotiate with the bondholders coming due and move the bond down the road, delaying payback like they've done with another bond several times, then if worst comes to worst, the cascading effect of multiple bonds coming due and there's no cash to pay it back could potentially lead to Tesla's bankruptcy. It would be a terrible thing for the shareholders and, I believe, for the world in general. Let's face it, Elon Musk has done a lot to get electric cars into the forefront of society's mind and to the big car manufacturers. VW is supposed to go all electric by 2025, something like that. BMW, Jaguar, GM, Toyota, everybody you can name is now making electric cars, and I don't think that tide is going to reverse. It'd be a real shame if Tesla was not there to enjoy the fruits of their labor.

Sciple: Yeah. Whether that's going to happen, I don't know. The takeaway here, I think, from this whole SolarCity acquisition, is you had a transaction where shareholders were promised --

Mueller: One thing.

Sciple: -- were promised that they'd have a company that could make lower-than-market-rate solar panels that would have a dominant market share, that would continue growth into the future, and would meaningfully contribute to the company's bottom line going forward as part of its master plan. What has materialized is a declining operating business, a large amount of debt that has saddled the company with a number of complicated issues. Now, you have to allocate cash that otherwise should be going to capex [capital expenditures] to build your new cars, all those sorts of things, needs to go to servicing this debt, as well. And then, to bring this back to the Walmart issue, and Amazon issue, as well --

Mueller: We didn't mention that one. Amazon also reported a fire on a roof of theirs that had SolarCity panels on it.

Sciple: Yeah. This story, on a number of levels, has also had a negative effect on Tesla. You have a perception issue when you have a very strongly worded negative lawsuit coming out from a major retailer like Walmart. As well, you have some amount of uncertain liability if this roof issue goes to other residential installations across the country. We've seen some follow-up reporting from Bloomberg on that.

Mueller: And how much will it cost Tesla to settle with Walmart? And how much did it cost to settle with Amazon? And how much will it cost to settle with all those homeowners? And on and on and on.

Sciple: It's a bag of worms that has really created a lot of issues for the company. We will say, Tesla has continued to tout the solar roof as something that is going to shift the narrative around the business. Again, customer trust has been impacted, as well. It's been a while since we've seen this come out. What are your thoughts on the prospects of the solar roof to turn the solar business around for Tesla?

Mueller: If they can do it, and if the product meets the high bar that Musk set for it -- cheaper than a regular roof, longer lasting than a regular roof, and that's not even counting the electricity the roof is going to generate for you -- if they can do that, then that could indeed turn the situation around. There are several questions. One, does that solar roof actually exist? Or is it engineering drawings still on paper and not in production? Two, how soon can they get those out? Three, how rapidly can they ramp it up, given the other constraints on their cash and their cash flow? And four, are they too late to the market? I mean, SolarCity has declined as a big player in the solar panel market. Are customers willing to come back to them and try a brand-new product that hasn't been tested, that's not even out there yet, and might not come to the promises that have been given so far?

Sciple: And has publicly caused a lot of fires?

Mueller: Well, the roof hasn't.

Sciple: True, true. It's to be determined. A lot of things with Tesla, there's always this promise out in the future, whether it's full self-driving or the solar roof or the Chinese factory. We'll see how things materialize. I will say that the solar roof has been promised since October of 2016 when the SolarCity merger was beginning to happen. We're today, in August of 2019. Likewise, self-driving was promised around that same time and has not materialized. Those things are the sorts of levers that, if Tesla can pull them [off], all these question marks arguably could go away. But lots of things to navigate. It's a tough time to be navigating these issues if you're management at Tesla today.

Alright, Jim, any positive thoughts going into Labor Day weekend? What are your plans?

Mueller: Well, there was some positive news for Tesla, actually. Moody's, the bond rating agency, had some good news for Tesla. They affirmed the bond ratings they had for Tesla's current bonds. That means they didn't make it worse. They improved what's called the speculative grade liquidity level, which is a rating of the risk that a company that will not be able to meet its short-term liabilities. That's a definition I'm reading off The Free Dictionary. Level from four to three, four being the worst, one being the best, most liquid. So four to three. That's an improvement. They also changed the outlook on the company from negative to stable. That's a big thing for a company when it has to negotiate new debt or roll debt out or what have you. Having a stable outlook from one of the major bond rating agencies is good news for Tesla.

Sciple: Yeah. We just had Elon Musk speak in China last night with Jack Ma, so we do have the China factory, also positive news coming down the line for Tesla. There's been some rumors that they're going to reveal that first vehicle they've produced at that factory. That'll be exciting to see. But lots to follow with this company in the future. It's always in the news, Jim.

Mueller: That it is. That's what makes being a shareholder exciting, I guess.

Sciple: It's a rollercoaster ride, for sure. Thanks for coming on, Jim, as always!

Mueller: Thanks for having me!"
91,0.9963,0.118,0.878,0.003,"The stock market continued its historic run Thursday as the NASDAQ Composite reached 9,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 also rose over 0.5% to a new all-time high, while the DJIA grew over 100 points. Consumer spending continued to anchor the economy as MasterCard (MA) reported a strong holiday season that was propelled by the digital marketplace.

As the consumer continues to display good overall health, some stocks look poised to reap the benefits in 2020. Let’s take a look at a few large cap stocks that will carry positive momentum into the new year.

Costco (COST - Free Report) is a company with a business model that can weather most twist and turns. The retailer has steadily maintained customer renewal rates around 90%, which is a testament to the continued success the firm has seen with its valued memberships. The treasure hunt nature of its giant warehouses keeps shoppers coming back to its stores to find the latest deals on almost any item imaginable.

Costco is coming off a first quarter where it saw its average transaction ticket rise 1.4% and its e-commerce sales jump over 5%. In addition to the recent success, Costco also pays out a dividend with a yield of 0.88%. The firm has also steadily raised its dividend for the better part of the past decade and has even paid out a special dividend recently.

Costco paid out a dividend of $7 per share in 2017, $5 per share in 2015, and $5 per share in 2012. Some investors believe that this special dividend may be paid out soon, which might make this an opportune time to pick up shares of the warehouse giant.

Our fiscal 2020 estimates call for a top-line increase of 6.5% to $162.7 billion and a bottom-line rally of 4.7% to $8.58 per share. Costco has seen its earnings revised higher, helping the stock earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is a stock that has put together a strong rally recently that can propel it into the new year. TSLA shares have risen over 62% since the company reported its third quarter results, where it reported $143 million in net income. The surprisingly profitable quarter for the company was followed by an announcement that stated it was on track to deliver at least 360,000 vehicles during 2019.

The electric vehicle manufacturer has also stoked investor optimism with its Gigafactory in China. Tesla is already making 1,000 Model 3s a week, according to a report from The Driven, which would put in on track to produce the 3,000 a week that Elon Musk expects once the factory is fully operational.

The company’s Gigafactory in China will be a key catalyst for years to come as Tesla attempts to expand its innovative products into the international market. In addition to its international endeavors, vehicle deliveries have soared, with trailing-12-month vehicle deliveries up an impressive 88%. Our 2020 consensus estimates call for earnings to soar over 1,200% to $5.73 per share and for net revenue to grow over 23% to $29.9 billion. Tesla has seen its earnings estimates revised higher giving the stock a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Microsoft (MSFT - Free Report) is a blue-chip stock that has put together a spectacular year with its shares up over 56%. The tech juggernaut is coming off a quarter where it saw its bottom-line improve 21% and its top-line gain 14%. MSFT has made its cloud operations a focal point as the public cloud service market is projected to grow at an annual growth rate of 12.6% to $331.2B in 2022.

Microsoft saw its intelligent cloud segment grow over 26% in Q1 to $10.8 billion and also secured a $10 billion cloud contract from the Pentagon in late October. The company had to beat out rival cloud services firm Amazon (AMZN - Free Report) to earn the lucrative government contract. As the cloud computing market continues to mature, Microsoft will likely see substantial growth in its cloud computing business.

In addition to Microsoft’s cloud operations, it pays out a dividend with a yield of 1.3%. The company has lifted its dividend payouts for the better part of the last 10 years and will likely continue this trend going forward, given its healthy balance sheet.

Our fiscal 2019 estimates project a bottom-line hike of 12.6% to $5.35 per share and for its top-line to climb over 11% to $140.1 billion. The firm’s cloud segment is forecasted to rise over 20% to $47 billion. MSFT looks poised to cash in on the secular shift towards the cloud and currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

92,0.9984,0.196,0.757,0.047,"Last week I detailed a way for investors with a big accumulated profit in a stock to protect most of the gains using a “collar” in which they purchase a put and sell a call.

I used Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) as an example of a stock that had recently appreciated rapidly, but these same principles can be applied to a position in any stock.

Analyst price targets vary wildly, with some predicting a steep fall and others remaining wildly bullish – with the possibility of doubling again in the immediate future.

If Tesla stays above $425 through expiration, the shares will be called away. As an investor, if you’re happy with that level of profit and unsure about future performance, you can just let that happen.

If you’re still bullish on the company long-term, you’ll have to do something to avoid selling the shares. I’ve explained this before, but it fits exactly in this current situation, so I’m going to repeat it. One of the best ways to preserve more appreciation potential is to roll the trade “up and out.”

Here’s a recent article about that trade.

There are a couple more things you might want to consider.

First, you still own that 375 put. It up to you to decide whether you still want that protection or whether you’d rather sell it for whatever remaining value it has before time-decay renders it worthless.

Second, assuming you have more than 100 shares – and therefore more than a one-lot options trade – you don’t have to trade the entire position the same way. In fact, for most investors who are unsure whether to hang on to a big winner or sell and take the profits, the most sensible answer is to sell a portion of the position and keep the rest.

In addition to simply being logical financial discipline, selling something around half of an appreciated position often has the psychological side effect of making a trader more objective about future decisions.

Simply put, when you have a big winner, it can sometimes make you less of a trader and more of a cheerleader. You might want the stock to double or be up some certain percentage or you might fear the risk of selling out and seeing the shares continue to rip higher, knowing you left a lot of opportunity on the table.

When you sell half, your expectations become much more manageable. Are you rooting for the stock to rally because you still have a long position? Of course.

Will you feel smart if the stock falls, because you had the foresight to grab some easy profits at the top? Probably.

Now that you have removed some of the emotional component – because now you’re actually a winner either way – you can stop “rooting” for anything and begin making rational decisions going forward about the current prospects for the stock and whether it belongs in your portfolio.

If you’re sitting on an investment that has done well for you and you still love the stock, by all means keep it. If you’re even a bit unsure however, selling part of the position is probably a good idea. No one ever went broke selling half – and you might be surprised how good it feels.

93,0.9983,0.145,0.825,0.03,"If we have to pick one auto stock that has emerged as the biggest winner for its investors in the past decade, it has to be electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) . Since its IPO in 2010, Tesla has skyrocketed 1,683%, breezing past the S&P 500’s 199% total return during the decade.

Tesla: The Auto Stock of the Decade

Over the years, Tesla has shifted from developing niche products for affluent buyers to making more affordable electric vehicles for the masses. The firm has also made inroads into solar and energy storage business. Along with green energy firms, Tesla received support from government subsidies to promote alternative fuels. In 2010, the company purchased a plant in Fremont from Toyota Motors to produce Model S and other vehicles. Tesla’s Model S sedan, launched in 2012, was a breakthrough electric car, which sent the shares of the company on a tear. Deliveries of Model X, a pricey crossover, commenced in 2015but it was the Model 3, which was rolled out in 2017 and marketed as an affordable alternative to its luxury Model X and Model S, which became the most popular Tesla car and one of the best-selling vehicles.

While the past decade has not been all smooth for the company— thanks to financial troubles at SolarCity, Tesla’s Autopilot crash, battery back fires, safety violations at Fremont, management turnover, SEC litigation and many other issues— it has managed to garner the reputation of a gold standard over the years. As 2020 draws closer, the firm is set to enter the New Year as a far bigger entity that what it started off since its IPO in 2010.

Lately, Tesla has taken the financial markets by storm and the rally in its stock price does not seem to stop. During the trading session on Dec 23, 2019, the company crossed the $420 mark. The $420 level was a price that Tesla’s CEO and founder, Elon Musk, had claimed he would take the company private at, and critics laughed. That infamous tweet last year had forced him to step down as the company’s chairman and pay $20 million fine as a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As Tesla crossed Musk’s target of $420 on Monday, the charismatic CEO took to Twitter again to acknowledge the rally “Whoa … the stock is so high lol.”

Now, with Tesla soaring to record highs, closing at $425.25 as of Dec 24, 2019, Musk seems to have a sweet revenge. Powered by investors’ faith in Musk’s vision, Tesla’s market cap is currently more than $76 billion, ahead of the Detroit 3— General Motors (GM - Free Report) , Ford (F - Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU - Free Report) .

Tesla on Fire Over the Past 3 Months

Over the past three months, Tesla’s rally has been breathtaking, with its share price appreciating a whopping 76%. So, what’s behind this bullishness? Well, the company’s surprise profit in the last reported quarter really boosted investors’ optimism surrounding the stock. Rising deliveries of Model 3 have been driving the stock. Also, progress at the company’s Shanghai Gigafactory, wherein production is ramping up, is a positive catalyst for Tesla. Recently, the firm also secured a 10-billion-yuan ($1.4 billion), five-year loan from a group of China banks in order to expand production at its Shanghai factory. A phase-one trade deal between the United States and Chinawould also boost its operations in the country. Musk also revealed plans for a fourth Gigafactory in Berlin, which will help Tesla avoid any export complications moving its cars to Europe. Plus, the company recently unveiled two new vehicle models, the crossover SUV Model Y and Cybertruck.

The Road Ahead Only Seems Brighter

Impressive sales of existing products, aggressive expansion efforts that will allow the company to manufacture and sell autos and batteries in Europe and Asia, and exciting future products have made Tesla one of the red hot stocks of the decade.

The company is finally meeting management’s highly ambitious goals. Considering the tailwinds, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock still has plenty of upside potential left. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Tesla is a robust long-term investment based on its market leadership, progressively broadening global operations and new product developments that are going to take the company to new heights in the coming decade. It appears that other aspirants in the auto market are going to have to keep chasing Tesla in the foreseeable future.

94,0.9961,0.137,0.845,0.018,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) has driven to an all-time high share price following its positive Q3 earnings report. TSLA rallied over 27% since the beginning of December, driving the stock to $422. The $420 level was a price that Tesla’s eccentric CEO and founder, Elon Musk, had claimed he would take the company private at, and critics laughed. Today this would be a discount to America’s favorite electric car company’s value today. TSLA has taken the financial markets by storm and defied an astronomical number of short-sellers.

The most significant catalyst to its most recent rally is the Shanghai Gigafactory 3, and its ahead of schedule-timeline, with cars being shipped out across China’s mainland as we speak. Tesla now has access to the world’s largest EV market, and the stock price is reflecting this.

The question we need to ask ourselves as investors is, has the short squeeze on one of the most shorted stocks in the market pushed this share price above its intrinsic value?

The answer is ambiguous at best, but we can get a better idea of what the market is thinking, by taking a look at both technical stock charts and prior expectations from TSLA bulls. We have been trading around its 50-day average (red line) for some time, but the stock’s most recent drive broke its way out of this range. Once traders gain their bearing next month, they will sell this stock back down towards its 50-day moving average.

Tesla investors and traders have been obsessed with this $420 price target ever since Musk announced his ostensible buyout at this valuation. This allegorical marijuana numbe has been a level held by the TSLA bulls. Hitting this price is a triumph for traders, and I believe it will also be a resistance level.

TSLA is historically quite volatile, with predictable support and resistance levels. I am confident that this $420 level is the new resistance level and is an excellent time to either exit your positions in this stock or even buy a $400 level put option for a January 17th expiration.

Take Away

Tesla is still a robust long-term investment based on both its market leadership and progressively broadening global operations that are going to take this company and its share price to the stratosphere (past $500) …but the stock’s volatility, I expect, will remain.

As a TSLA bull, I will wait for this stock to fall back down to a price of around $300 to put a more substantial position on these shares in the coming months.

95,0.9825,0.097,0.889,0.015,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) recently secured a 10-billion-yuan ($1.4 billion), five-year loan from a group of China banks, in order to expand production at its Shanghai factory. Reportedly, part of this new loan will be used to roll over some of the company’s previous debt.

Tesla aims to utilize 3.5-billion-yuan of the new loan to roll over an existing debt, while the remaining amount will be invested in the company’s Shanghai factory as well as other China operations. The banks which have agreed to provide Tesla with financial aid include China Construction Bank (CCB), Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB).

Earlier this year, these China banks had issued a 12-month loan of up to 3.5-billion-yuan for Tesla, slated to be repaid on Mar 4, 2020. The interest rate of the new loan will be the same as the 3.5-billion-yuan loan, pinned at 90% of China’s one-year benchmark interest rate.

The Shanghai factory is Tesla's first car manufacturing site outside the United States. It is anticipated to boost sales and will help avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars. The company commenced production at the factory this January and aims to build at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of this year.

industry it belongs to over the past year. Its shares have appreciated 41.9% compared with the industry’s rise of 35%.

The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All

Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early."
96,0.9988,0.149,0.834,0.017,"With 2019 drawing to a close, we're about to put another decade in the books. One of the major storylines over the past 10 years has been the advancement of renewable energy, which has gone from a niche market supported by government subsidies to one that's growing briskly without any assistance.

The sector's emergence over the past 10 years hasn't been without its share of growing pains. Overly aggressive expansion caused the industry to have too much capacity at times, while also burdening some companies with more debt than they could handle. Those issues caused several renewable-energy stocks to burn their investors by delivering poor performance.

A small handful of companies, however, have stood out by generating excellent returns for their investors. Here's a look at the five best ones from the past decade.

Enphase Energy: A 250% return since its IPO

Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), which makes microinverters for solar panels, didn't make its public market debut until March 2012. However, the company has been a big winner as its 250% return since its IPO has outpaced the 165% total return from the S&P 500 during that time frame. However, it's worth noting that the entire gain has come this year, as it's been the best-performing solar stock of 2019. Powering that performance has been the explosive growth in its revenue (up 97% year over year) and earnings (up 495% year over year) thanks to the increased adoption of its microinverters, which help convert the energy generated by the sun into usable power. That fast-past growth should continue in the coming decade because Enphase has worked hard to significantly expand its addressable market.

Brookfield Renewable Partners: A 318% total return this decade

Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) continued to generate market-beating total returns for its investors over the last 10 years. Its 318% total return came in comfortably ahead of the S&P 500's 261% total return during the decade. One factor powering those returns has been the hydropower-focused company's ability to continue growing its high-yielding payout. It has increased its distribution to investors by a 6% compound annual rate since 2012, powered in part by its ability to buy cash flowing renewable power generating assets. Not only has the company continued investing in hydropower, but it also added wind and solar to its portfolio over the past decade. Brookfield Renewable, meanwhile, expects even more growth in the coming decade, which could enable it to continue generating high-powered total returns for its investors.

SolarEdge Technologies: A 344% return since its IPO

SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG), which makes power optimizers that perform a similar function as Enphase's microinverters, didn't come public until 2015. However, it has been red-hot since then, generating a more than 344% return, which has blown past the S&P 500's 67% total return during that timeframe. Like Enphase, it has also been red hot this year, as its stock has more than doubled in 2019 alone. That fast-paced growth should continue in the coming decade as the company not only continues to supply the solar industry with low-cost power optimizers, but also expands into new markets like energy storage and electric vehicle charging. Because of that, it could continue generating strong returns in the coming years.

NextEra Energy: A 555% total return this decade

NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has been a big winner over the last decade as its 555% total return has more than doubled that of the S&P 500. While utilities aren't typically known for being big outperformers, NextEra has been able to shine due in large part to its investments in renewable energy. Since it started focusing on investing in the sector in 2005, the company has been able to grow its earnings at an 8.5% compound annual rate, which is by far the fastest pace among the largest power companies. As a result, it has outperformed its peers as well as most stocks in the S&P 500 over the last several years. Meanwhile, with the company ending the decade with one of the largest backlogs of renewable-energy development projects in its history, it has plenty of power to continue growing at an above-average rate in the coming years.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been the best renewable-energy-focused stock over the past decade. The electric-vehicle maker has grown from making a niche product for deep-pocketed buyers to producing zero-emission vehicles for the masses. On top of that, it made inroads into the energy storage and solar markets. While it hasn't always been a smooth ride, Tesla's stock has richly rewarded investors who believed in the ability of its controversial yet visionary CEO, Elon Musk, to deliver. Meanwhile, with a growing number of new products in development, the company's stock could continue riding higher in the coming decade.

Renewable energy could be an even bigger winner in the next decade

While the renewable-energy sector as a whole has underperformed over the past decade, it could deliver much better results in the next 10 years. That's because companies and governments need to pour trillions of dollars to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels. While lots of stocks should benefit from those investments, these five companies appear well positioned to continue winning given their proven track record in recent years."
97,0.9497,0.07,0.907,0.023,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already expanded into two additional markets beyond electric cars: energy storage and solar. Now the company wants to add a fourth leg to its business: insurance. Tesla announced an auto insurance service on Wednesday, which will be offered through a new business called Tesla Insurance Services.

Meet Tesla Insurance

Perhaps as part of a move to roll out the service gradually while working out kinks, Tesla Insurance will only launch in California at first. But the company says it will expand to more states over time. The service is available for all of the company's vehicles, including the Model X, Model S, Model 3, and Roadster.

The key to Tesla Insurance is its affordability, according to the company.

""Tesla Insurance is a competitively priced insurance offering designed to provide Tesla vehicle owners with up to 20% lower rates, and in some cases as much as 30%,"" the company says. The automaker believes it will pull this off because of its direct understanding of its vehicles' technology, safety, repair costs, and advanced driver-assist technology.

Tesla also implied that the price of its insurance will come down over time: ""Tesla Insurance reflects the benefits of Tesla's active safety and advanced driver assistance features. As with all Tesla products, Tesla Insurance will continue to evolve in order to provide lower total cost of ownership and increased ease of customer experience.""

The company is making it easy for new or existing Tesla owners to sign up for Tesla Insurance, with purchasing a policy on its website taking as little as a minute.

Investors shouldn't bet on Tesla Insurance yet

If many Tesla owners can really get lower rates through Tesla Insurance, a large portion of the company's loyal customer base could choose the new service. But investors should wait to see signs of success before they start betting the new venture can contribute to the company's business performance.

Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE:BRK.B) (NYSE:BRK.A) Warren Buffett argued in the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this year that Tesla's decision to get into the insurance business could be a mistake. ""It's not an easy business,"" he said. Buffett knows a thing or two about insurance. Not only is GEICO a Berkshire subsidiary, but Berkshire owns insurance companies that insure other insurance companies. ""Our [insurance business] has been the engine propelling Berkshire's growth since 1967,"" Buffett wrote in the company's 2018 letter to shareholders.

But a case could be made that Tesla may not be aiming to profit from insurance -- at least maybe not in the near term. The company could have other motives for the new service, such as streamlining the purchasing experience, getting customers more entrenched in its ecosystem, and lowering the total cost of ownership."
98,0.9722,0.085,0.855,0.059,"Believe it or not, the electric car isn't exactly a new idea.

The first modern electric vehicle debuted in the 1800s, but the technology was sidelined as more popular internal combustion engine vehicles came to market after the turn of the century. In the decades that followed, companies and regulators flirted with an EV future, but their efforts stalled out.

In this video from our YouTube channel, we break down the history of the electric car, how it almost disappeared in the early 2000s, and how Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) brought the technology back from the brink.

A full transcript follows the video.

Narrator: Hi, and welcome to The Bottom Line. In this video, we're going to take a closer look at the fits and starts electric vehicles have experienced over the past few decades, why some automakers are choosing to make hybrids vs. electric cars, and why all-electric vehicles are likely the future.

The very first electric cars debuted in the early 1800s and began growing in popularity by the end of the century.

But Henry Ford's mass-produced Model T debuted in 1908 and that, along with the invention of the electric starter for automobiles, quickly helped put an end to the early growth of electric vehicles.

But in the early 1990s, the electric car began experiencing a resurgence.

A 1990 California law said that by 1998, 2% of the vehicles that large manufacturers produced for sale in California had to be zero-emissions vehicles. And the percentage would increase to 10% by 2003.

The problem was that the electric cars that automakers created in the wake of this new law were expensive to produce. And even the most popular ones, like GM 's (NYSE:GM) EV1, only had a range of about 100 miles, which was far below the average range of gas-powered vehicles.

To make matters worse for electric cars, gas prices were very low in the mid-1990s. The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in California at the end of 1996, was less than a $1.20 per gallon.

Those low gas prices — combined with a strong U.S. economy — meant that American drivers were looking to buy larger vehicles without much concern for gas mileage.

Additionally, many of the strict requirements first introduced by California were challenged in court, and eventually watered-down.

But the electric car came back with a vengeance in 2006 when Tesla did something that all other automakers had failed to do. It made the electric car cool.

The company's first vehicle, the all-electric Roadster had a range of 245 miles, which matched the lower end range for gas-powered engines. Oh, and it went from 0-60 mph in just 3.7 seconds.
While Tesla has had its share of problems, there's no denying that the company has helped electric vehicles become more mainstream.

In 2018, ten years after launching its original Roadster, Tesla produced 350,000 vehicles. Far more than the 2,400 Roadsters it sold between 2008 and 2012.

Now nearly every automaker is seeing the value of selling electric vehicles, but it's not just consumer demand that's driving the shift. Both China and Europe are putting pressure on automakers to reduce vehicle emissions.

China, which is the world's largest automotive market, penalizes automakers if they don't sell a minimum amount of zero-emissions vehicles. This is causing some automakers to move away not just from internal combustion engines, but also from hybrid vehicles as well.

GM and Volkswagen (OTC:VLKA.Y) recently said that they're abandoning development of hybrid vehicles and focusing their attention on all-electric cars.

GM will bring 20 electric vehicles to market by 2023 and Volkswagen is bringing a new plug-in electric SUV to the U.S. in 2020 and launching an electric minibus by 2022.

Of course, not all automakers are betting on electric vehicles in the same way. Ford (NYSE:F) is working on both electric and hybrid versions of its popular F-150 pickup truck and Toyota (NYSE:TM) is working to put its hybrid technology into more of its vehicles.

While automakers may disagree whether hybrids or electrics are the better long-term solution for creating low-emission vehicles, it's clear that both have become serious alternatives to the internal combustion engine.

Some experts predict that electric vehicles will make up 7% of the U.S. automotive market in 2030, with hybrids taking 23%.The Bottom Line is: With Volkswagen, GM, and others focusing more of their resources toward electric vehicles -- and Tesla's vehicles already leading the way -- it's likely that electric vehicles are finally here to stay."
99,0.8671,0.058,0.901,0.041,"Reportedly, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) is set to lift vehicle prices in China this week itself, amid escalating U.S.-Sino trade tensions. The price raise, which was earlier scheduled for September, is likely to come into effect on Aug 30, owing to the tit-for-tat tariff fight between the United States and China, along with a decline in the yuan.

The U.S. auto giant is reportedly mulling to hike prices again in December, if China follows through its plans to reimpose 25% tariff on U.S. cars and 5% on auto parts, which it had discontinued in April.

Tesla is one of the many U.S. carmakers including Ford (F - Free Report) , General Motors (GM - Free Report) and others that are getting affected by the intensifying trade tiff. Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk already considers U.S.-Sino trade tensions as a deterrent to American carmakers. With China being the largest market for electric vehicles, Tesla’s sales in the country may be hampered by increasing tariffs.

Since the company currently has no local production in China, it is directly impacted by any tariff increase. Currently, all Tesla cars are manufactured in the United States and then shipped to China, resulting in an increase in logistics expenses. If the trade tiff aggravates, import tariffs could further increase. Further, Chinese currency yuan tumbled to 11-year low against the U.S. dollar on Monday, as trade tensions gripped the market. Weakening yuan will adversely impact Tesla’s earnings, on conversion to dollars.

Importantly, the company is currently constructing a plant in China as its cars are subjected to steep tariffs and sales are shrinking amid the trade war. Tesla plans to start production in the country, once it completes the construction of the Gigafactory 3 plant in Shanghai. Notably, the firm is in advanced talks with South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. to buy batteries for the electric vehicles manufactured at the Shanghai plant, according to reports. Initially, the LG Chem batteries for Model 3 cars. The move is part of Tesla’s plans to diversify battery suppliers, as it currently sources batteries exclusively from Panasonic.

100,0.9808,0.088,0.862,0.05,"Oil consumption continues to rise in the U.S. and around the world, but as electric vehicles keep growing as a percentage of vehicle sales, there will ultimately be a tipping point on multiple fronts. The first will be manufacturers investing in more EVs to ultimately overtake internal combustion engines, which is happening today from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Porsche.

The bigger tipping point will be a peak in oil consumption that the world will (likely) never look back from. We don't know when peak oil will happen, but given the cost reduction of EVs and the focus on reducing emissions around the world, it's only a matter of time.

EV sales are still booming

There's no question that Tesla has led the EV revolution the last decade, and it's helping drive the industry's growth. According to the website Inside EVs, Tesla has already sold 99,525 Model 3, S, and X vehicles in the U.S. through July 2019, and total U.S. EV sales across all manufacturers were 176,174 thru seven months of 2018, a 14.5% increase from 153,854 a year ago.

Global electric vehicle sales were 1,105,405 in the first six months of this year, a 46.9% jump from 752,690 a year ago. It's this growth on a global level that's going to lead to that tipping point.

No matter where you look, EV sales are going up. And in 2020 and 2021, there will be even more options coming to the market from Porsche, Ford, Kia, Mini, and many more.

Meanwhile, overall auto sales are falling

As EV sales are rising, overall vehicle sales are falling. You can see the steady decline in U.S. auto sales below, and according to the Center for Automotive Research, global auto sales are expected to fall by 4 million units in 2019 from about 79 million a year ago.

EVs are still only a fraction of total global sales with 2 million to 3 million vehicles expected to be sold this year. But sales are growing even as overall sales decline.

Why is oil consumption going up?

If EV sales are going up and auto sales overall are going down, then why is the chart above showing that oil consumption is rising? The two reasons: Larger vehicles, like trucks and SUVs, are a bigger portion of the sales mix, and people are driving more with the vehicles they have.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, total highway miles driven have been rising steadily since 2011, including during the period of declining auto sales that you see above.

In the U.S., light trucks are now a whopping 69% of the market. That includes small SUVs up to large trucks, but these vehicles are typically less efficient than cars, so as they increase in numbers, they increase oil consumption.

It'll take time to overcome the trend to larger vehicles and the higher oil consumption that comes with it. But remember that it was only a few years ago that oil consumption in the U.S. was declining because the economy was weak and fuel efficiency was going up. Trends can reverse quickly inside the traditional auto industry, and with EVs continuing to take share, a reversal in consumption growth could happen quickly.

Is the tipping point coming?

EVs will continue to take market share in the auto industry, and for the companies investing in new technology, that may not change their volumes much. GM, Volkswagen, and Nissan are some of the early leaders in EV technology and will continue to increase EV volumes. Of course, Tesla will be leading the charge. Every automaker will be impacted by the growth of EVs, and those getting out in front of it will be best off financially.

Where there's more uncertainty on the investment impact is in oil consumption. If SUVs continue to rise as a percentage of overall sales, there could be an increase in oil consumption overall for years, but the share of EVs in the total vehicle population is simultaneously going up. If oil prices rise in response to greater fuel consumption, then it could make EVs look even better by comparison. Given the lower fundamental cost of operating an EV, there may be no going back once that happens.

When the recession hit in 2008, oil prices tumbled from over $140 per barrel to less than $40, and there was only about a 2% decline in overall demand. If EVs create a structural decline in oil demand, it could have a devastating impact on the oil industry -- and it's coming more quickly than it might seem."
101,0.9871,0.115,0.816,0.069,"Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, with the latter planning to restart levies on American autos, have impacted the shares of leading U.S. carmakers and dented their prospects in Chinese markets.

Tit-for-Tat Tariffs

A few weeks back, Trump had announced a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, to be implemented from December. In retaliation to tariffs implemented on Chinese goods in the United States by the Trump administration, China was forced to take countermeasures and impose tariffs on the country on Aug 23, thereby escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions.

China will slap tariffs ranging from 5-10% on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods. The Chinese tariffs will be imposed in two batches, one on Sep 1 and another on Dec 15. China also intends to resume tariffs on U.S. cars and auto parts/components, which it had discontinued in April. Beijing plans to impose 25% tariff on U.S. cars and 5% on auto parts, effective Dec 15, 2019.

As a countermeasure, Trump threatened to increase the tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 15%, as early as Sep 1. The United States will also increase the existing tariffs on another $250 billion worth of Chinese imports from 25% to 30%, effective Oct 1.

The rising trade rift between the United States and China, resulting in tit-for-tat tariffs without any meaningful negotiations, is likely to have a negative impact on the auto industry. China’s renewal of 25% tariffs on U.S. auto imports may have an adverse impact on the U.S. automobile industry. Notably, U.S. auto exports to China have declined significantly ever since the world’s second-largest economy decided to impose retaliatory tariffs.The U.S. vehicle exports to the country became half, when China imposed tariffs last year.

Tariff War Pushes Auto Stocks to Low Gear

Amid the intensifying trade tensions and imposed tariffs on U.S. cars and auto parts, shares of major U.S. automakers including General Motors (GM - Free Report) , Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) , Ford Motor (F - Free Report) , among others, slumped. Shares of General Motors declined 3.22% to close the trading session at $36.06 on Aug 23. Shares of Ford fell 2.99% to close the session at $8.77 while Tesla declined 4.84% to $211.40 on Friday.

Per LMC Automotive, Tesla and Ford are the top exporters of U.S. vehicles to China, just behind Germany-based BMW (BAMXF - Free Report) and Daimler (DDAIF - Free Report) . As such, the tariff imposition is likely to considerably impact these U.S. carmakers.

Although Ford’s performance in China was not very impressive in the first half of 2019, China is an important market for the firm. The company expects Chinese, North American and European markets to be the key growth drivers, going forward. However, with the new rounds of tariffs by China, Ford’s sales in Chinese markets may be affected.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk already considers U.S.-Sino trade tensions as a deterrent to American carmakers. With China being the largest market for electric vehicles, Tesla’s sales in China may be hampered. However, once the company completes the construction of the Gigafactory 3 plant in Shanghai, it will be able to avoid the tariff hike partially.

Owing to slowdown in the Chinese economy, General Motors’ income from China declined year over year in the latest quarterly release and the company expects no improvement in the same before 2020. With General Motors already struggling in China, imposition of tariffs may result in a further slowdown in its growth. Nonetheless, the company has production facilities in the country, which could somewhat shield it from tariffs.

Notably, while Ford and General Motors carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Tesla holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

102,0.9393,0.06,0.894,0.046,"Everybody's talking about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). As usual.

The carmaker can't go a few days without being in the news for something. When I started writing this article, it was the story that Tesla has lost a $5 million Model 3 order from a German car rental company over defective equipment. By the time I finished, it was Walmart 's lawsuit against Tesla for defective solar panels. By the time this article is published, I won't be surprised if some other piece of Tesla news is splashed across the front pages.

With all the nonstop coverage of Tesla's ups and downs, it can be tough to get a sense of the larger picture at the electric-car maker. Let's dig a little deeper to see whether Tesla is a buy.

More cars, less revenue

One of the biggest contrasts in Tesla's raw numbers was on display in the company's Q2 earnings report. Tesla delivered a record number of cars during the quarter, reporting 95,356 vehicle deliveries. That was a 134% increase over Q2 2018 and a 4.8% increase over its prior record, set in Q4 2018. The company is confident that the cost per vehicle of the Model 3 will continue to decline as production increases, which is critical for Tesla's financial success.

However, despite delivering more vehicles than in Q4 2018, the company's revenue was down 11.9% from that quarter. That's because the company is selling fewer of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X. The company is also making less profit per vehicle, because the Model S and Model X sport higher margins than the cheaper Model 3.

The good news is that Tesla seems to be successfully executing its initial long-term strategy of starting with a high-end luxury sports car (the Roadster) to raise interest and initial capital while gradually offering lower- and lower-priced vehicles to appeal to the mass market. The bad news is that this strategy might not be paying off for investors.

Funding the plan

If Tesla were a mature car company that only had to worry about building cars in existing assembly plants and selling them through established sales channels, that would be one thing. Unfortunately (or, maybe, fortunately), that's not Tesla.

Tesla is still a fledgling manufacturer. Even though its Gigafactory is now online and churning out vehicles, the company is still in high-growth mode. It's spending money developing a Model Y crossover SUV and a Tesla pickup truck and building a factory in China to avoid Chinese tariffs and hopefully make inroads into the lucrative Chinese market. It's also trying to sell more of its cars (and solar and battery products) while simultaneously closing Tesla stores to cut costs.

That's a lot for one company, and it's why Tesla has only managed to turn a quarterly profit three times in the last five years. Meanwhile, the company has continued to add to its debt load, which recently surpassed $13 billion, nearly one-third of its current market cap. Tesla's valuation metrics are way out of whack with the rest of the auto industry, and there are very real concerns that the company is on an unsustainable financial path.

That path may only get harder to climb as we head into 2020.

The only game in town

Tesla has benefited from being one of the first manufacturers to offer all-electric vehicles to U.S. consumers, particularly sedans and the mid-size Model X SUV. By contrast, most of the all-electric competition in the U.S. up to this point -- including General Motors ' Chevy Bolt and Nissan 's Leaf -- has consisted of compact or subcompact hatchbacks. That's about to change, though.

Several of Tesla's competitors have electric vehicles set to launch in 2020. Ford will roll out an all-electric crossover SUV based on its iconic Mustang next year. Audi and Porsche are working on all-electric ""super sedans"" rumored to begin production in late 2020 as well. Tesla's brand is certainly valuable and a status symbol in a way that Chevrolet and Nissan aren't...but Mustang, Audi, and Porsche might be able to hold their own against Tesla in a battle of the brands, especially given the fact that Tesla's advertising budget is minimal.

Given the shift in Tesla's sales toward the Model 3, it appears that consumers didn't necessarily want a Model X or S; they wanted a Tesla. Soon, though, we'll see whether consumers actually want a Tesla or just an electric sedan or SUV. And you can bet that Ford's, Audi's, and Porsche's robust and well-funded marketing departments will try to convince them of that.

What it means for investors

In a recent episode of the Motley Fool's Industry Focus podcast, my colleague Nick Sciple had this to say about Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions: ""From the information I've been able to see, I believe that it's very much a long shot. But, if it works out, it is a massive, massive opportunity. We'll just have to see.""

That sentiment could be applied to Tesla in general. The whole company has been a massive long shot from the get-go and has overcome numerous challenges to get where it is today. But it's far from clear if the company's current strategy and financial situation are sustainable, especially as competition gets fiercer, margins get slimmer, and the company's debt continues to climb.

Given all that, Tesla just looks too risky right now to call it a buy."
103,0.9954,0.108,0.843,0.049,"It looks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Waymo's self-driving-car development is gaining ground at an impressive pace this year. Concerns were raised last year about how well its autonomous vehicles would fare under real-world conditions, but the company has eased doubters' fears with its progress toward commercialization.

Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has promised that his company will change the game in self-driving cars. According to Musk, Teslas are already being built with all the hardware necessary for them to become fully autonomous, once the software catches up. He has said he foresees the day coming soon when Tesla owners will be able to turn their personal vehicles into robotaxis, and earn as much as $30,000 a year by letting the cars drive themselves to ferry other passengers around.

That, of course, has yet to happen. And while Waymo has been making some concrete progress, its self-driving taxi service has only had a limited rollout so far. But for investors looking to profit from the potential of this trend, the question may be: Is Alphabet a better self-driving car bet than Tesla? Or will Musk's ambition supercharge his company's stock in the long run?

Waymo is taking it one step at a time

After commercially launching its self-driving service in the Phoenix metro area late last year, Waymo has gone one step further in 2019 by partnering with Lyft. The ridesharing specialist will be adding 10 Waymo cars to its fleet in Phoenix.

Though this is a very small pilot project, the partnership offers a glimpse into a potential self-driving future. Ridesharing companies such as Lyft and Uber are embracing autonomous driving tech in hopes that it will offer them a path to profitability, and Waymo can show them the way.

After all, the Alphabet subsidiary's vehicles have logged over 10 million autonomous miles on actual roads, and more than 10 billion miles in simulation. With all that experience, Waymo is now set to take part in California's self-driving-vehicle passenger service pilot program. Though the Alphabet subsidiary won't be able to charge customers (who will primarily be Waymo's employees and their guests, traveling within a limited area in South Bay), the company sees it as another step toward expanding the Waymo One taxi service.

For now, there will still be safety drivers behind the wheel of Waymo's autonomous vehicles, but this is how the company is operating. The cautious approach is meant to ensure that those cars aren't involved in any fatal accidents, a few of which have occurred with other companies' self-driving vehicles.

Last year, Waymo became the first company in California to operate fully autonomous cars without backup drivers. So it might not be long before it starts operating a commercial autonomous taxi service there.

Tesla keeps making big promises, despite stutters

Tesla's approach to autonomous driving tech differs significantly from Waymo's. CEO Musk has been trumpeting how self-driving tech will make Teslas more desirable to buy, as their owners will be able to passively make money by allowing them to operate as robotaxis.

Musk recently said on Twitter that the price of Teslas would increase significantly once its cars are upgraded to have a full autonomy mode. Moreover, Musk has predicted that there could be a million Tesla robotaxis on the road sometime in 2020, though that seems like an optimistic prediction.

While all that sounds really good on paper, investors shouldn't forget that Tesla has a brash attitude toward autonomous driving, and it seems to be making promises before it has ironed the kinks out of its tech. Failures of its driver-assist Autopilot system have been blamed for causing fatal crashes, including one earlier this year.

While Autopilot is a level 2 autonomous system, meaning the human driver is supposed to constantly supervise it -- you're driving, not the car -- not all Tesla owners are so careful. Still, the gaps in Autopilot's ability to detect certain types of obstacles serve as a reminder that this technology isn't fully cooked, and it would be unethical for Tesla to deploy true self-driving vehicles without testing them extensively.

Also, Tesla seems to be grappling with liquidity issues. Musk in May called on employees to reduce costs as the company was burning through cash at the rate of $200 million a month. At that rate, Tesla was at risk, as it had only a few months of cash left after raising $2.4 billion from investors. It remains to be seen how much Tesla will be able to invest in self-driving development while also maintaining sufficient liquidity.

Of course, Musk has also advertised that Tesla cars can be given improved self-driving abilities via over-the-air software updates. But there's some doubt those will be allowed to go online without intensive testing given Tesla's safety record. This is where Alphabet's Waymo enjoys the upper hand. After millions of miles of testing on public roads and billions of miles in simulation, it has already started taking baby steps toward the commercialization of its autonomous taxi service.

This gives Waymo the first-mover advantage in a robotaxi industry that's expected to boom. According to B2B research firm MarketsandMarkets, the global robotaxi market is expected to grow from just over 2,000 cars in 2020 to more than 3.8 million cars in 2030. Investment bank UBS predicts Waymo will capture 60% of the self-driving market in just over a decade, and it isn't difficult to see why.

So if you're looking to invest in a self-driving car stock and weighing Tesla vs. Alphabet, it's clear which one is in the driver's seat right now."
104,0.9832,0.1,0.829,0.07,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is making another last-gasp effort to save its solar business after CEO Elon Musk announced a relaunch over the weekend. Tesla will rent a solar system to customers in some states for as little as $50 per month and will sell a system for between $10,830 (3.8 kW) and $32,490 (11.4 kW) before tax incentives. On the surface, they seem like decent deals, but Tesla hasn't done much right in solar over the last three years, so there's reason to be skeptical.

Solar installations have fallen nearly 90% since Tesla acquired SolarCity, and some investors (myself included) think the days of solar at Tesla are nearly done. The latest attempt to resuscitate Tesla's solar business seems simple enough, but there's no evidence it's going to work, and some parts of the new sales process seem downright strange. I don't think the latest rebrand will do anything to change Tesla's fundamental problems in solar.

Solar over the internet gone wrong

Musk's tweet over the weekend makes Tesla's solar relaunch seem like a no-brainer for consumers.

With the new lower Tesla pricing, it's like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 18, 2019

Tesla has simplified what it's offering, giving customers the choice between a 3.8 kW system, a 7.6 kW model, and a large 11.4 kW solar system. But that's where the simplicity ends.

Since most solar installers are selling door-to-door, they can assess the suitability of a home for solar and explain the benefits before a contract is signed. Tesla puts most of the onus on the homeowner, only starting to assess the suitability of solar ""after you place your reservation"". What does a reservation entail? It requires you pay $100 and ""agree to the Energy Order Purchase Agreement."" With the click of a mouse, I could have been obligated to spend as much as $32,490 on a solar system that hasn't yet been designed with no idea what my savings would be and no clue when installation would occur. Only ""in some cases"" will Tesla send an actual person to your home before installation, instead relying on aerial footage and pictures from the homeowner to design the system.

There is one out for buyers with this line in the contract: ""You, the buyer, may cancel this transaction at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of this transaction.""

You have three days to jump ship, otherwise, you're technically obligated to buy an undetermined solar system from Tesla at an unknown time in the future. Wait, what!?

Solving the wrong problem

Tesla is trying to move its sales process online, but that's been exactly the problem for the company. Solar is an expensive and complicated investment for a homeowner. Companies like Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) and Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR) lock customers into a 20- to 30-year contract and they lay out the savings and what a solar system will look like on a home, all usually in person.

This is a time-intensive and expensive process, but it's valuable, and that's exactly why those companies are growing while Tesla is shrinking. Customers need the hand-holding; they need assurance that what they're signing up for will look good on their home and that it'll save them money. Signing a contract for an unknown product seems like it's moving in the wrong direction.

If you look at another company gaining market share, you'll see what Tesla could be doing. SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) says it will launch a tool that will allow a homeowner to get a solar system designed and quoted, along with estimates of cost savings, in less than a minute. We don't yet know what information SunPower will require to get the quote completed because the product isn't launched yet, but I doubt a fully executed contract will be part of the process.

Where Tesla might be on to something

As skeptical as I am of Tesla succeeding with its solar strategy, I do think the rental model is a lot better for consumers than the leases or power purchase agreements currently preferred by Sunrun and Vivint Solar.

Current financing requires customers to sign onerous contracts that lock them into decades of payments to solar installers. If they sell a home, the new homeowner has to take on the lease or there are penalties the current homeowner has to pay. Even when a 20-year lease is complete, companies require a homeowner to buy an old solar system or sign a new lease.

Tesla is offering a $1,500 fee to abandon the rental and remove the solar system. That seems like a fair deal for consumers. If this pushes other solar companies to embrace terms that are more friendly to consumers rather than lock them into multidecade contracts, it could lower a hurdle to even wider adoption. With a small breakup fee, Tesla may actually be on to something.

Solar isn't where Tesla wants to be

If the rental/online sales model doesn't work, Tesla may need to consider exiting the solar business. It's a distraction at this point and isn't driving significant revenue. Working with partners to include solar with electrical vehicle sales would be a better idea, and long-term, I think that's where Tesla will want to be."
105,0.9999,0.152,0.84,0.008,"The global economy has an addiction to fossil fuels, burning through an ever-increasing amount of oil, coal, and natural gas. While it is projected that the earth has enough oil in reserve to last the economy through at least 2050, there's still only a finite amount of these energy resources available. Worse yet, scientists have shown that our continued burning of these greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels is quickening the pace of climate change.

Given the severe issues facing fossil fuels, many organizations have been working on developing cleaner, alternative sources of energy to combat these and other problems. While the renewable energy industry is still developing, sector leaders are beginning to emerge. Given their size and expertise, these companies will likely be key players as the industry continues growing in the coming decades.

Investors who are learning how to invest in renewable energy stocks should get to know these industry leaders. That way, you'll have a better understanding of what made these companies successful, which should help you identify the characteristics needed to win in the renewable energy sector.

The biggest alternative energy companies

The renewable energy industry is broad. It includes:

Entities that generate electricity from the wind, sun, and water
Companies that make systems and components to produce renewable energy
Businesses that manufacture battery systems to store renewable energy
Companies focused on building electric cars and recharging infrastructure
Entities that make renewable fuel replacements such as wood pellets, ethanol, renewable natural gas, and biodiesel

The 10 largest companies that generate a majority of their revenue from one of those activities -- and also trade on the major U.S. stock exchanges -- are on the following chart:

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)

$42.1 billion

Electric vehicles, solar panels, and battery storage

First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR)

$6.7 billion

Solar panel manufacturer

Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP)

$6.4 billion

Hydroelectric power

SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG)

$3.9 billion

Solar optimizers and inverters

Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH)

$3.9 billion

Microinverters

Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA)

$3.6 billion

Geothermal power

TerraForm Power (NASDAQ:TERP)

$3.4 billion

Wind and solar power generation

NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP)

$2.8 billion

Renewable power generation and natural gas pipelines

Atlantica Yield (NASDAQ:AY)

$2.4 billion

Clean power generation, electricity infrastructure, water assets

We'll take some time to look at each one of these renewable energy stocks and to focus on why they've grown to be so important to the development and advancement of clean energy.

1. NextEra Energy: The world's largest producer of wind and solar energy

NextEra Energy is an energy-focused holding company. It operates two Florida-based utilities (Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power) and an energy resources segment that mainly invests in clean energy assets. Together, the company's business units lead the world in producing renewable energy from the wind and sun. In addition to that, NextEra is a world leader in battery storage.

In 2019, NextEra's energy resources segment owned or operated 15.1 GW of wind and 2.5 GW of solar power generating capacity. That's enough to power 12.8 million average American homes -- although due to intermittency and other issues, the actual electricity generated would at best only cover half that number. Meanwhile, the company had another 11 GW of renewable energy projects in its backlog as of the middle of 2019. That gives it plenty of power to grow its lead in the coming years.

NextEra Energy grew into the world's largest renewable power producer by building projects and selling the electricity generated to end users under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs). That business model made it a trusted partner for companies that wanted to go green. Meanwhile, its focus on securing contracts that lock in pricing provides it with predictable cash flow to reinvest into new developments so that it can continue growing.

2. Tesla: More than just an electric-car company

Tesla is an auto manufacturer focused on developing plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In 2018, it ranked as the largest EV maker, selling nearly 250,000 units, which was 12% of the market. In addition to making cars, the company also manufactures rooftop solar panels and battery storage units.

The company took a unique approach to achieve its goal of eventually building affordable EVs. It started by making a premium sports car targeted toward early adopters. It rolled its learnings from that venture into other vehicles that targeted broader markets, first luxury and then the mid-sized sedan segment.

Tesla has also taken a different operating path than most automakers. Instead of relying on third parties to build the components it needs, Tesla has developed many in-house. Among its most significant investments has been that in building out a large-scale battery manufacturing facility called a Gigafactory to drive down costs. The company's Gigafactory 1 is the world's largest battery factory and has the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour. It produces almost half of the battery capacity needed to power the global electric vehicle industry.

Tesla has helped shrink the cost of manufacturing EVs, which has made them more affordable. That's helping accelerate their adoption so that they've become more mainstream. However, by growing the EV market, Tesla has also increased its competition, because both big automakers and new entrants have poured money into building their own EVs.

In addition to its vertical integration, Tesla has also sought out horizontal opportunities to expand its renewable energy ecosystem. The company, for example, acquired a solar panel manufacturing and installation company, Solar City, in 2016. Thanks to that, it can offer customers a complete system to generate and store electricity at their homes, which they can use to recharge their EVs.

3. First Solar: Focused on thin-film solar

First Solar specializes in manufacturing thin-film solar modules that use cadmium telluride as a semiconductor instead of crystalline silicon, which is common in most other panels. First Solar's modules have a larger size overall and are more expensive. However, they can produce more energy per panel, which makes them cheaper on a cost-per-watt basis. That has made these panels ideal for utility-scale solar projects because they generate lots of lower-cost renewable energy.

The company has invested heavily to stay one step ahead of its rivals. It has done that by spending money on research and development as well as on building out its manufacturing capacity. The company began rolling out its latest breakthrough product, the Series 6 module, in 2018. It invested more than $1 billion in the product, which included constructing manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Asia.

Another driving force behind First Solar's rise in the solar sector is that it has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. The company expects to end 2019 with $1.8 billion of net cash on its balance sheet. Add that to the free cash flow the company should generate as it transitions fully to the Series 6 module, and it has tremendous financial flexibility. That gives it the funds to continue investing in groundbreaking products that make solar energy more affordable and efficient.

4. Brookfield Renewable Partners: A leader in hydropower

Brookfield Renewable Partners is a publicly traded partnership created by leading asset manager Brookfield Asset Management to own and operate renewable energy assets around the globe. The company initially focused on owning hydroelectric power generating plants. However, it has diversified over the years to also operate wind, solar, and energy storage facilities. In 2019, hydropower remains the largest contributor at 75% of its portfolio.

The company makes money by selling most of the power it generates under long-term, fixed-rate PPAs with end users. Those agreements help insulate the company's cash flow from electricity rates, which can be quite volatile, especially in some of the countries in which Brookfield operates.

Because Brookfield Renewable Partners generates such predictable cash flow, it's able to return the bulk of it to investors via a high-yielding dividend. The company aims to distribute 80% of its cash flow, retaining the rest to invest in expansion projects. Those expansions, when combined with contractual rate increases, have the company on track to grow its cash flow at a 6% to 11% annual rate through 2022. That will give it the power to increase its dividend at a 5% to 9% yearly pace over that time frame.

While organic growth projects are an important driver of Brookfield Renewable, the company has grown into one of the largest renewable energy companies mainly through acquisition. It has targeted financially weaker companies, which enables it to buy attractive renewable energy assets at value prices. It then leverages its operational expertise to improve the profitability of those assets, which makes them more valuable.

5. SolarEdge Technologies: Optimizing renewable energy

SolarEdge developed an optimized inverter solution that improved the way solar panels converted the DC power they produced into AC used by the electricity grid. The company's intelligent inverter solution enables solar panels to maximize power generation while reducing the cost of producing energy from a solar panel. This solar component maker has gone on to develop several other products that help improve the way solar panels turn the sun's rays into electricity.

The company has also made several acquisitions to expand its opportunity set beyond the solar market. In 2018 and 2019, for example, SolarEdge made a couple of deals to bolster its capabilities in the energy storage market. It's a natural extension for the company given that energy storage is becoming a crucial enabler of the renewable energy sector. Meanwhile, the company has also made deals targeting the EV market by acquiring companies focused on recharging products.

In a way, SolarEdge is taking a page out of Tesla's strategy playbook by pursuing vertical integration. In this case, it's expanding its capabilities to cross-sell components to related renewable energy markets.

6. Enphase Energy: A leader in microinverters

Enphase Energy focuses on manufacturing inverters that convert DC power from solar panels into AC. It was the first company that successfully commercialized microinverters, and it remains the market leader. Enphase's approach differs from that of SolarEdge: Enphase's inverters directly convert solar power from DC to AC, while SolarEdge's optimizers require an additional component, known as a string inverter, to finish the task. While SolarEdge's approach is slightly cheaper overall, Enphase Energy's microinverters are a bit more efficient.

The solar component maker has grown into one of the largest renewable energy companies by investing in developing new products that keep it one step ahead of competitors. The company focuses on making more-efficient and lower-cost inverters. For example, Enphase Energy built its latest-generation IQ 7 microinverter on the same platform that powers the Internet of Things and data centers. Meanwhile, it's developing the IQ 8 inverter, which will be even smaller and more powerful than the IQ 7. This could make it a key component in energy storage products.

As both the solar and storage industries grow, Enphase Energy should be able to keep expanding as long as it maintains its technology lead.

7. Ormat Technologies: A leader in geothermal power

Ormat Technologies is the largest company focused on harnessing the power of geothermal energy. It operates a portfolio of geothermal and recovered energy generation plants in the U.S., Central America, Asia, and Africa. It also designs, manufactures, and sells power generating equipment and other products to third-party geothermal operators. Ormat typically makes 67% of its revenue from its electricity segment and the rest from its product segment.

Like many power generation companies, Ormat sells most of the power it produces under long-term PPAs. Those contracts provide it with predictable cash flow. While the company uses some of those funds to pay a small dividend, it reinvests the bulk of its cash flow to expand its operations. These investments have included a combination of organic growth projects and acquisitions.

Ormat's investments in increasing new geothermal energy generating capacity have enabled it to consistently grow earnings. From 2014 through 2018, the company's adjusted EBITDA increased from $273 million to $368 million as new projects came online. The geothermal-focused company expects that growth to continue. It had between 120 MW and 135 MW of new projects underway in mid-2019, which would power growth through the end of 2021. While geothermal energy might not have the growth potential of other renewables, Ormat Technologies has made a name for itself by dominating this niche.

8. TerraForm Power: Focused on wind and solar in North America and Western Europe

TerraForm Power is another renewable energy company managed by Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield Asset Management, along with Brookfield Renewable Partners, acquired a controlling stake in TerraForm following the bankruptcy of the wind and solar power generator's former parent. While Brookfield discussed combining TerraForm with its namesake renewables arm, its major investors wanted the company to remain independent. As a result, Brookfield has worked directly with TerraForm to improve its operations and refocus its efforts on operating wind farms and solar projects in North America and Western Europe.

Like its sibling, Brookfield Renewable, TerraForm Power also sells the bulk of the electricity it produces under long-term, fixed-rate PPAs. Those agreements provide the company with predictable cash flow. It aims to pay out about 80% of that money to shareholders via a high-yield dividend. That enables it to retain some cash flow to invest in expanding its portfolio. Among the opportunities it's pursuing is repowering some of its older wind farms by upgrading the existing turbines to newer, more powerful ones.

The company has also taken a page out of the Brookfield playbook by making acquisitions a major part of its growth strategy. In 2018, TerraForm bought a Western European solar and wind platform that grew its portfolio by 40%. Meanwhile, it followed that up with another large-scale deal in 2019, which further bolstered its solar portfolio. One of the driving forces of these deals is that TerraForm aims to increase the underlying profitability of the assets it acquires by improving operations. That's helping make renewables a more viable investment option.

9. NextEra Energy Partners: A strategy to generate high-powered dividend growth

NextEra Energy Partners is a master limited partnership (MLP) created by utility NextEra Energy to help drive its renewable energy growth strategy. It formed NextEra Energy Partners to appeal to income-seeking investors since it would pay a higher-yielding dividend and increase it at a faster pace. NextEra would power this dividend growth plan by dropping down clean energy assets (wind farms, solar projects, and natural gas pipelines) it owns to NextEra Energy Partners. Its MLP would use the growing cash flow from these acquisitions to power its dividend growth plan, while NextEra would reinvest the sales proceeds into new renewable energy projects.

The two companies typically complete at least one large-scale transaction each year. In March of 2019, for example, NextEra sold a portfolio of six wind and solar projects to the partnership for $1.02 billion. That deal provided NextEra Energy Partners with enough power to increase its high-yielding dividend by 15%. That kept the company on track with its goal of growing its payout at a 12% to 15% annual rate through at least 2024.

In addition to its acquisition-powered growth, NextEra Energy Partners has started investing money into expanding some of its existing assets. In 2018, for example, it locked up an opportunity to increase the capacity of its natural gas pipeline system. Meanwhile, it's also working on wind repowering projects to boost the output at some of its legacy facilities. With ample growth opportunities, NextEra Energy Partners has plenty of power to continue increasing its higher-yielding dividend at a fast pace in the coming years.

10. Atlantica Yield: A diversified clean energy portfolio

Atlantica Yield is a diversified infrastructure company. It owns and manages a portfolio of renewable and clean energy assets, as well as electricity transmission infrastructure and water assets. In 2018, the company generated about 68% of its revenue from renewable energy. Its portfolio consisted of wind farms and solar assets in the U.S., Spain, South Africa, and Uruguay as well as a small hydro facility in Peru. In addition to that, the company operated a natural gas-fired power plant in Mexico, electricity transmission lines in Peru and Chile, and water desalinization facilities in Algeria.

The company has secured long-term PPAs or other regulated-rate structures for all its expected capacity. That strategy enables Atlantica Yield to generate predictable cash flow, the bulk of which it returns to investors via a high-yield dividend. The company uses the cash it retains and its strong balance sheet to invest in expanding its portfolio.

Atlantica Yield has a bold strategy to grow its dividend at an 8% to 10% compound annual rate through 2022. Powering its plan is a strategic partnership with Algonquin Power & Utilities, which acquired a stake in Atlantica Yield in 2018. Algonquin has supplied Atlantica with both growth opportunities and capital, which have helped fuel its expansion strategy.

The largest renewable energy companies expect to get even bigger

The global economy needs to invest trillions of dollars in transitioning from fossil fuels and renewables. In light of that, the alternative energy sector should continue growing at a healthy pace for many years to come. This outlook suggests the biggest renewable energy companies will likely expand their lead in the future. That makes them an ideal starting point for investors who are interested in this fast-growing sector."
106,0.9401,0.082,0.863,0.055,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) . Shares have lost about 2.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Tesla due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

Tesla Earnings and Revenues Miss Estimates in Q2
Tesla reported loss per share of $1.12 in second-quarter 2019, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 54 cents. The company recorded loss of $3.06 per share in the prior-year quarter.
During the reported quarter, net loss attributable to common shareholders amounted $408.3 million compared with the year-ago net loss of $717.5 million.
Revenues increased to $6.35 billion from $4 billion registered in second-quarter 2018. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.38 billion.
During the quarter under review, Tesla reported record delivery of 95,356 vehicles and production of 87,048 units. This surpassed the previous records achieved in fourth-quarter 2018.
Total automotive revenues, including that from automotive sales and leasing, increased 60% year over year to $5.38 billion in the reported quarter.
Energy generation and storage revenues decreased from $374.4 million in second-quarter 2018 to $368.2 million in the reported quarter. Services and other revenues increased significantly year over year to $605.1 million.
Tesla’s second-quarter 2019 automotive gross margin was 18.9%, decreasing 168 basis points (bps) from second-quarter 2018.
Energy generation and storage gross margin decreased 20 bps to 11.6% on a year-over-year basis.
Financial Position
Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $4.95 billion as of Jun 30, 2019, compared with $2.24 billion, as of Jun 30, 2018.
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $863.6 million in second-quarter 2019 compared with $129.7 million of net cash used in second-quarter 2018. Capital expenditure declined to $249.7 million from $609.8 million in the year-ago quarter.
Model 3 Update
In second-quarter 2019, Tesla reported record Model 3 delivery of 77,634. During the quarter, the production rate of Model 3 continued to improve. The company targets to produce 10,000 vehicles of each model by the end of 2019.
Outlook
Tesla is making efforts to raise vehicle deliveries. This is in sync with its previous delivery guidance of 360,000-400,000 vehicles in 2019. Importantly, the company expects positive quarterly free cash flow. It anticipates 2019 capital expenditure to be about $1.5-$2.0 billion, marking a reduction from the previous guidance.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review. The consensus estimate has shifted -13924.98% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

Currently, Tesla has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months."
107,0.9353,0.097,0.828,0.075,"It seems like every few months Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is in the news for a scandal or some production issue. TSLA has also been a hot stock for young investors and people searching for massive growth potential from a firm in game-changing industry.

You can see in the chart below that this combination of investors, coupled with Tesla’s mixed history of big strikeouts and home runs and CEO Elon Musk’s eccentric management style, has created extreme volatility.

Tesla’s latest woes came not in the form of missed production targets, but from a lawsuit. Walmart (WMT - Free Report) on Tuesday filed a scathing lawsuit against Tesla for alleged breach of contract, gross negligence, and failure to live up to industry standards for the production and installation of solar panels at many of Walmart’s stores.

Walmart claims that these poor-quality solar panels caused fires at seven of its stores. The retail giant claims that “Tesla routinely deployed individuals to inspect the solar systems who lacked basic solar training and knowledge.” WMT also alleges Tesla failed to ground its solar and electrical systems correctly and that some solar panels installed at Walmart stores had a high number of defects visible to the naked eye. Walmart claims Tesla inspectors should have identified and replaced these panels before they led to fires.

Walmart is seeking compensations for damages to buildings, inventory, and for evacuations. It is also wants Tesla to remove solar panels from the additional 240+ stores where they have been installed.

Alleged Backroom Dealings

In November 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity in a $2.6 billion all-stock buyout. The infrastructure, patents, and personnel gained form this merger allowed Tesla to start its solar division. In the lawsuit, Walmart highlights familial ties between the two companies, calling it a flawed merger.

It alleges that this is the underpinning of the poor craftsmanship and service. “On information and belief, when Tesla purchased SolarCity to bail out the flailing company (whose executives included two of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s first cousins), Tesla failed to correct SolarCity’s chaotic installation practices or to adopt adequate maintenance protocols, which would have been particularly important in light of the improper installation practices,” Walmart said in the lawsuit.

This is hardly good for Tesla’s image, as it looks like, based on the lawsuit’s claims, that its solar city acquisition might have been made to help family members, instead of actually expanding the company and benefitting shareholders.

Solar Woes

Solar panels have not yet become a large part of Tesla’s business, as was expected at the time of the acquisition. During SolarCity’s heyday, Q4 2015, it installed over 200 megawatts of solar panels in a single quarter (enough to power about 130,000 homes). But last quarter, Tesla installed just 29 megawatts of solar, a huge decline from previous quarters. This could also show that the solar revolution Musk predicted is not yet here.

When Tesla acquired SolarCity, it showed off sleek solar panels that looked exactly like standard roof shingles to justify the expensive purchase. However, this technology is still not on the market, with only 12 homes installed as test cases. These solar roofs also cost around $100,000 for a house with a 2,250 sq. ft. roof. This means that this hypothetical house would have to save about $520 per month, much more than the average electricity bill, to make the solar roof a profitable investment against putting the money into a 30-year treasury bond.

Tesla Outlook

This quarter (Q3), earnings are projected to fall 104.8% from the year-ago period to -$0.14, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. However, analyst estimates for the quarter range from -$0.60 to $0.57, showing that Tesla is at least a little messy financially and earnings number are hard to predict.

For the full year, earnings are expected to drop 137.6% from 2018 to -$3.16. For fiscal 2020, earnings are then estimated to skyrocket to +$4.82 on the year, in a sign that it will hopefully start to recover from its history of large losses.

However, estimates tend to not mean much for Tesla as earnings surprises generally happen in huge magnitudes every quarter. The past two quarters saw negative surprises over 100%, while Q3 2018 saw a 627% positive surprise.

Our estimates call for revenue to shrink this quarter by about 3.2% over last year, but then come back up by 2.57% next quarter over Q4 a year ago. Full year revenue is predicted to jump 15.7% to $24.83 billion. In fiscal 2020, revenue is expected to keep rising another 23.86% to $30.75 billion.

Bottom Line

Tesla currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), due to earnings estimates for the current quarter and full year tanking in the past month. Tesla is estimated to have another rough year, but estimates show hope down the road.

This lawsuit is just the latest in a long line of Tesla’s financial, legal, and regulatory troubles and likely won’t have an immense impact on the bottom line. However, investors must start to question when, or if, the pot of gold will materialize at the end of Tesla’s rainbow.

108,-0.9837,0.072,0.808,0.12,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) investors are screwed.

It isn’t as if the company’s core electric car business is without issue. But in 2016, it went and bailed out the debt-laden SolarCity, which was owned by Elon Musk’s cousins and in which he himself was an early investor. The result: Tesla’s own balance sheet got hugely levered.

And there was a reason why SolarCity was going downhill, as Walmart’s (WMT - Free Report) lawsuit has brought to light. Not only was the company incompetent, but it was also grossly negligent in the carrying out of its obligations under the contract.

Tesla’s market share further dwindled following the acquisition and it’s now a distant third with 29 MW of new installations since the acquisition. Market leaders SunRun and Vivint Solar installed 103 MW and 56 MW, respectively.

In Walmart’s case, it resulted in seven rooftop fires, the first few of which the company dismissed as stray incidents. But in 2018, there were three fires, the first in Beavercreek, Ohio (March 2018), followed by two in Denton, Maryland and Indio, California.

The fires didn’t result in loss of human life, but millions of dollars’ worth merchandise was lost, according to the company. That’s when Walmart asked Tesla to deactivate the panels on all 240 Walmart roofs. This is a costly affair for Tesla and outside the contract requirements, but given the risk, especially considering the number of people routinely frequenting the stores, it may not have been unreasonable.

Unfortunately, even after Tesla complied, there was another fire in a Yuba City, California store in November 2018.

Specific Complaints

The lawsuit claims among other things that the solar panels were defective in terms of design, were improperly installed, and safety measures for their maintenance and operation were below industry standards.

Moreover, Tesla’s own inspections had revealed 157 items requiring attention with 48 serious enough to render the sites unsafe. Walmart’s subsequent inspections exposed even more problems.

It also said that Tesla failed to identify defects, such as the hotspots appearing on many panels, which crack the back sheets and damage the electrical insulation. Moreover, Tesla was pasting red tape over the spots where it identified the problem, which blocked sunlight in those areas and created even more hotspots.

The failure to tighten field-made connectors facilitated moisture and water intrusion.

The maze of wires was often under pressure from sharp objects like concrete or metal edges, or were in expansion or contraction mode depending on the weather.

The inspection staff was found to be deficient in knowledge and training and was inadequately equipped to do the job.

The lawsuit was filed after Tesla’s inadequate responses to Walmart’s concerns. Walmart is claiming millions of dollars in damages and the right to uninstall the panels in the lawsuit filed Tuesday in New York state court.

So it’s no wonder the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell-rated) company’s shares are swooning.

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were slammed Wednesday, falling 6.5% by the time the market closed.

While a significant portion of the decline can be attributed to a sharp pullback in the overall stock market on Wednesday, particularly growth stocks like Tesla, another concern may have been an analyst note on the company's high executive turnover rate.

So what

Top executives at the company have an annual turnover rate of about 27%, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi's research. This is the highest of seven peers, including prominent Silicon Valley-based tech companies Uber, Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) Snap (NYSE:SNAP), and Netflix.

Tesla's annual turnover rate of top executives is 27%, said Sacconaghi. That compares to a 15% average for the seven peers the analyst benchmarked Tesla against. Snap and Lyft had the second and third-highest turnover rates out of the peer group, with rates of 24% and 23%, respectively.

""While one could argue that TSLA's high turnover reflects its unique and demanding culture, we worry that such turnover not only causes instability but could also reflect more significant concerns among senior leaders about the company's direction or workplace practices,"" wrote Sacconaghi in a note to clients (via Bloomberg).

Now what

Tesla's high executive turnover is certainly a narrative investors should keep an eye on. The company's most prominent executive departure recently was its chief technology officer, JB Straubel. The executive played a key role in Tesla's technologies, particularly when it came to batteries. Though Straubel did say he will serve in an advisory role to the company."

At present, the company produces and sells three fully-electric vehicles — the Model S sedan, the Model X sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) and the Model 3 sedan.
Recently, the company made good progress in Model 3 delivery. In fact, record Model 3 sedan delivery is aiding Tesla to overcome waning Model S sales. In second-quarter 2019, it delivered more than 95,200 vehicles that not only exceeds the year-ago quarter’s level but also surpasses fourth-quarter 2018 figure of 90,700. Of the total deliveries in the second quarter, Model S and Model X totaled 17,650 while the number for Model 3 was considerably higher at 77,550. The company made tremendous progress by efficiently organizing its global logistics and enhancing cost efficiencies.
Tesla is also focusing on building Gigafactory to produce batteries in collaboration with various partners. In January 2019, the company began the construction of Gigafactory Shanghai. In second-quarter 2019, it started to shift machinery into the facility for the first phase of production.
However, some factors, which are affecting Tesla’s results, are high research and development (R&D), and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. The company is investing heavily to increase production capacity, develop Model X and Model 3, construct the Gigafactory, and expand sales, services and Supercharger infrastructure.

112,0.9864,0.093,0.854,0.053,"When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) acquired SolarCity for $2.6 billion in 2016, it was the U.S.'s biggest residential solar installer by a wide margin. Since then, management has laid off workers from the unit, changed its sales strategy, and stood by as competitors took market share from it year after year. After the dismal quarter it just completed -- another in a long string of them -- it looks like Tesla has now fallen behind Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN), Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR), and SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) for market share in residential solar.

The bigger problem is that Tesla may not have any way to recover from this decline. The infrastructure that built SolarCity is gone, and new products that once had promise don't seem to be anywhere near reality.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen

In the first quarter of 2019, Tesla installed 29 megawatts (MW) of solar, which was down 65% from a year earlier, and nearly 90% off its single-quarter peak of 258 MW, set in 2015. It's also less than what Sunrun (86.2 MW), Vivint (45.6 MW), and SunPower (52 MW) installed in the quarter. (None of them have released their Q2 2019 reports yet.)

That steep drop came at the same time as Tesla slashed the cost of its solar products to less than $2 per watt (after tax benefits) and moved its sales to an online model. The theory was that customers would flock to buy via the website due to the lower cost, but the that's not what's happening. As it turns out, residential solar system sales are moved more by installers pushing them door-to-door than they are pulled by consumers demanding green energy.

Where are the new products?

Investors didn't expect Tesla's residential solar business would turn out this way. In 2016, the company announced a solar roof that promised to change the business forever by integrating solar cells into roofing tiles. It was arguably the most innovative product ever introduced in the solar industry, but its unveiling by Elon Musk seems to have been the high point in its life cycle. Today, the solar roof is little more than an afterthought for Tesla.

A more incremental innovation of high-efficiency solar panels that tied seamlessly into the home were supposed to make the company's offerings more appealing. That doesn't appear to be moving the needle either.

Finally, the Powerwall doesn't seem to have done anything to help the solar business. Tesla has in the past asserted that EVs, energy storage, and solar belonged together, and predicted that customers would buy all three at once. The company's energy storage business is booming, driven by growth in utility and commercial scale projects, but its residential Powerwall isn't helping drive solar system sales at all. In short, the case for a fully integrated renewable energy company seems to have been debunked.

Where does Tesla solar go from here?

Musk and Tesla may not be officially giving up on solar energy yet, but they might as well at this point. Solar has shrunk to a tiny portion of the company, and it's probably more of a headache than a value-adding business at this point. Given the fact that three competitors now have a larger market share, it may be time to move on.

Tesla could potentially sell its manufacturing facilities and technology to competitors. A premium solar supplier like SunPower might be interested in the solar roof technology, although there probably isn't much financial value to the product, given how little traction it has found in the market.

The installation business and the portfolio of solar assets still on Tesla's balance sheet would also have value, potentially for a company like Sunrun or Vivint Solar.

Finally, Powerwall could be the biggest beneficiary if Tesla got out of solar. It is arguably a best-in-class product, but competitors are no doubt reluctant to promote to their customers the idea of using an energy storage system and inverter made by a rival. However, if Tesla shuttered its solar business, it could partner with multiple installers on energy storage.

Tesla has proven that it has no future in solar manufacturing and installation. It's time investors recognize that reality."

The nascent energy storage business had a rare chance to grab some headlines on Monday when Tesla announced a new battery system called Megapack, designed to address the needs of utility grids. The Megapack system will help Tesla build on its early momentum in the important energy storage space.

Meet Megapack

Tesla's Megapack is a new battery product designed and engineered ""specifically for utility-scale projects,"" the company said in a blog post on Monday.

The energy storage unit is a significant upgrade from Tesla's Powerpacks, which had a 210 kilowatt-hour capacity. The company announcement said: ""Megapack significantly reduces the complexity of large-scale battery storage and provides an easy installation and connection process. Each Megapack comes from the factory fully assembled with up to 3 megawatt-hours (MWhs) of storage and 1.5 MW of inverter capacity, building on Powerpack's engineering with an AC interface and 60% increase in energy density to achieve significant cost and time savings compared to other battery systems and traditional fossil fuel power plants.""

This will make projects like the 129 megawatt-hour battery storage Tesla installed in Australia in late 2017 much easier to deploy, as the company says that Megapack installation will be 10 times faster than the installation of its older Powerpack energy storage product for utilities.

A key catalyst

Tesla's energy storage segment is growing rapidly. In Q2, it deployed 415 megawatt-hours of energy storage capacity, up 81% year over year. In addition, management said its residential energy storage solution, called a Powerwall, is now installed at over 50,000 different locations.

Zooming out beyond a single quarter, Tesla deployed 1.04 gigawatt-hours of energy storage capacity in 2018, nearly tripling the 358 megawatt-hours of energy storage the company deployed in 2017.

Today, the total footprint of Tesla's energy storage products represents a cumulative capacity of over 2 gigawatt-hours -- and the company believes its launch of Megapack will help this number ""accelerate exponentially in the coming years.""

Its second-quarter update said that, ""Additional cell supply combined with our new module line designed by Tesla Grohmann enabled a step change in energy storage production.""

Now Tesla just needs demand to keep growing -- something the launch of a new and improved energy storage product may help along."
114,0.9915,0.127,0.78,0.093,"The good news for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors in the company's Q2 earnings report was that the electric-vehicle pioneer didn't lose as much money last quarter as it did during the first three months of 2019. The bad news was that it still lost plenty of money, far more than analysts had anticipated.

In addition, CEO Elon Musk sowed further confusion about Tesla's future profit trajectory. The company also reiterated its full-year deliveries forecast, without providing much evidence that its target is really achievable. Finally, Musk offered a rosy -- but potentially unrealistic -- outlook for 2020 and beyond. All in all, the earnings report raised more questions than it answered. This caused Tesla stock to plunge 14% on Thursday, retracing its gains of the past few weeks.

Another hefty loss

In the first quarter, Tesla recorded a massive loss of $702 million, or $4.10 per share. In the second quarter, that improved to a loss of $408 million ($2.31 per share). Management noted that the company incurred $117 million of restructuring and other charges last quarter. But even adjusting for those expenses, Tesla missed analysts' expectations for profitability.

Tesla blamed its big quarterly loss on several factors. While deliveries reached a record of 95,356 -- slightly higher than the company's preliminary estimate -- Tesla began delivering the low-margin, entry-level Model 3 (priced at just $35,000) last quarter. It also cut the prices of older versions of its Model S and Model X, and regulatory credit revenue fell sequentially. As a result, automotive gross margin fell to 18.9% from 20.2% a quarter earlier and 20.6% in Q2 2018.

Excluding regulatory credits, automotive gross margin improved by about 2 percentage points compared to the first quarter. However, on that basis, automotive gross margin declined by more than 2 percentage points year over year.

In other words, despite cost reductions, it's clear that Tesla's price cuts -- of which there was another just this month -- and unfavorable mix shifts are hurting profitability in a big way. What isn't clear is whether Tesla may be able to stem the bleeding over time by continuing to reduce its costs and improve productivity.

Cash flow improves, but is it sustainable?

While Tesla lost a ton of money last quarter, it did generate $614 million of free cash flow. That was a nice turnaround from the first quarter, when it burned through more than $900 million.

The return to positive cash flow wasn't very surprising. Tesla produced 87,048 vehicles in the second quarter, whereas it delivered 95,356. Assuming an average selling price between $50,000 and $60,000, Tesla's sales of vehicles that had already been built may have added as much as $500 million to its cash flow last quarter. This was pretty much a one-time boost, as Tesla exited the quarter with very lean vehicle inventory.

Furthermore, capital expenditures totaled just $250 million last quarter. While Tesla reduced its full-year capex guidance this week, it would still need to spend an average of nearly $500 million a quarter in the second half of 2019 just to hit the low end of its new guidance range.

Normalizing for its inventory reductions and a more sustainable level of capex, Tesla's free cash flow would likely have been negative again last quarter. It remains to be seen whether the company can improve its underlying cash generation to keep free cash flow strongly positive over the next several quarters.

More orders and deliveries needed to hit 2019 targets

In conjunction with the earnings report, Tesla maintained its forecast that it will deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019. It delivered just 158,375 vehicles in the first half of the year, though. Thus, quarterly deliveries would need to average more than 100,000 over the next two quarters just to reach the low end of the guidance range.

On its face, that seems achievable. After all, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 vehicles in the second quarter, so its delivery pace wouldn't have to accelerate all that much.

However, demand and supply both represent potential hurdles that could hamper Tesla's ability to reach its goal for deliveries. On the supply side, Tesla produced just over 87,000 vehicles last quarter, so it would need to substantially raise output to reach its target. That might be feasible, but management has repeatedly overestimated Tesla's ability to implement sustained production increases over the past few years.

As for demand, Tesla's Q2 order activity may have been boosted by a looming cut to the federal tax credit for U.S. buyers. So far, there hasn't been a sharp drop-off in orders this quarter, but the recent price cuts do cast doubt on the strength of demand.

Two things that could change Tesla's trajectory

On Tesla's earnings call last week, Musk postulated that demand for the company's vehicles could surpass 2 million units annually within a few years. Tesla stock's post-earnings plunge makes it clear that most investors see this as wishful thinking. Indeed, just reaching the low end of this year's forecast by delivering 360,000 vehicles seems like it could be a stretch.

Yet this notional target isn't as outrageous as it may seem. Tesla is on track to start building the Model 3 in China later this year. That will allow it to avoid hefty import tariffs, enabling lower prices that could drive a surge in orders. Meanwhile, production of the Model Y crossover could begin as early as next year. Given that most consumers prefer crossovers to sedans these days, it's plausible that the Model Y will outsell the Model 3 by a wide margin.

On the other hand, Tesla will face dramatically more competition a couple of years from now than it does today. The Chinese auto market has been in free fall for the past year, so counting on China to drive a substantial amount of growth seems like a dubious proposition. And under current law, the Model Y won't benefit from any federal tax credits in the U.S., which could put its price tag out of reach for most consumers.

The disappointing second-quarter earnings report wasn't a sign that Tesla is doomed. That said, it raised a lot of uncomfortable questions about whether the company can achieve its lofty goals. Investors are still waiting for answers."
115,0.9492,0.107,0.814,0.079,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was slammed this week. Shares fell 14% on Thursday, following the electric-car maker's second-quarter earnings release. A 134% year-over-year increase and a much narrower loss than in the year-ago quarter weren't enough to impress investors. Instead, worse-than-expected revenue and a wider-than-expected adjusted loss per share overshadowed these factors, spooking some investors.

As investors mull over the company's latest quarterly results, investors can find more insights about Tesla's business in the company's second-quarter earnings call. Three notable topics discussed during the call were the Model 3's gross margin, demand trends, and the importance of word-of-mouth marketing.

An improving Model 3 gross margin

On the surface, investors may have viewed Tesla's automotive gross margin of 19% during Q2 as a negative. After all, the key metric is down from 20% in the first quarter of 2019 and 21% in the year-ago period. But a 19% automotive gross margin is impressive when you consider that the company's lower-cost Model 3 went from accounting for less than half of deliveries in the year-ago quarter to more than 80% in the second quarter of 2019.

Helping explain why Tesla's automotive gross margin didn't fall even more as the company's lower-cost Model 3 deliveries grew to represent a larger portion of revenue, CFO Zachary Kirkhorn confirmed that the vehicle's gross margin has been improving.

""For Model 3, global [average selling prices] stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a sequential reduction, yet gross profit per Model 3 improved, representing the continued success of our cost management efforts,"" Kirkhorn said.

Demand is increasing

Concerns about demand for Tesla's vehicles continue to be overblown. Deliveries in Q2 were a record high as orders for the company's cars were higher than they were during the prior quarter. And this trend is continuing into Q3 as the pace of orders so far during the quarter are ahead of where they were at this time during Q2.

Kirkhorn was particularly pleased with Tesla's recent demand trends, saying, ""[W]e've demonstrated our ability to generate significant organic demand, as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were non-reservation holders.""

Word-of-mouth marketing is key

Word-of-mouth marketing has historically played a key role in the company's demand generation. This remains the case today, as CEO Elon Musk confirmed during the company's earnings call this week.

""I think really what we find is that the word-of-mouth for Tesla is incredibly good,"" Musk explained. ""So once there's a new piece of customers in a particular area, they love the cars and they talk to all their friends about it, and that's really what drives sales.""

This is reminiscent of the rising demand for Model S after the vehicle's launch. ""Importantly, we are seeing orders in a particular region increase proportionate to the number of deliveries, which means that customers are selling other customers on the car,"" Tesla said in its first-quarter shareholder letter in 2013.

Tesla backed its optimism about demand trends with a forecast for deliveries to increase sequentially in Q3. In addition, management said it expects full-year deliveries to be between 360,000 to 400,000, representing 45% to 65% year-over-year growth."
116,0.9906,0.114,0.816,0.07,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) released earnings last night, keeping investors in anticipation for almost an hour after the bell. When the trading algos were finally able to code in the sales and EPS miss, they immediately ripped the stock down 10% in after-hours trading. Today traders pulled it down even further from the $264.88 close last night to $227.44 an over 14% drop in less than 24 hours.

I am still optimistic about the future of Tesla. Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai is on track to start producing Model 3’s by the end of the year and the Model Y, a compact SUV, starts deliveries in the US early next year. A European Gigafactory is in the planning stage, which would put Tesla one step closer to world EV domination.

The surge in cash from the convertible bond and equity offering last quarter, along with positive free-cash-flow has eased TSLA’s liquidity concerns, putting them on track to effectively grow the business.

Tesla delivered a record 95,356 vehicles in Q2, most of which were Model 3s, demonstrating 59% year-over-year topline expansion but still missing marginally missing estimates. Unfortunately, the company also posted a $408 million loss ($117 million of which was associated with restructuring) or an EPS loss of $1.12, missing estimates by 107%.

Free-cash-flow was the one shining star in Tesla’s 2 nd quarter results coming in at $614 million. The robust FCF was due to reductions in capital expenditures, although not sustainable in the long run, illustrates systemic operational awareness and improvement.

The biggest issue that investors had with Tesla’s Q2 earnings was the significant margin cuts, which were due to the lower margin Model 3, which is expected to drive the company’s growth in the future. Margins were also pinched from taking a cut on average sales price (APS) for old Model S and Model Xs to get these vehicles off the lot for the newer models.

As the Model 3 scales production, I expect economies of scale will be realized, and margins will expand as sales do.

Buying Opportunity

I see Q2 earnings as a blip in Tesla’s long run drive to take over the automotive world. There is no question that electric vehicles (EV) are the future of transportation on earth, with millennials’ focus on a cleaner world.

Tesla is far ahead of the curve in EV production, with its futuristic design and long-range batteries that no competitor can match. It will be years before the other auto-makers catch up and by then Tesla will be miles ahead. Automakers like General Motors (GM - Free Report) , Ford (F - Free Report) , and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU - Free Report) are all working on adding EVs to their line up within the next few years.

Gigafactory 3 that is almost done being built outside of Shanghai, is going to be a game-changer for Tesla. China’s EV market is double the size of the US’s and should grow as the government pushes more and more incentives.

Tesla is already delivering 850 vehicles a week in the 1 st half of 2019 to China, once they are domestically made I see this figure growing exponentially. The firm wants to be producing 3,000 Model 3s a week by the end of this year.

The short term liquidity concern that pulled TSLA shares so far down in the first half of 2019 is no longer a burden.

As more and more Model 3s are produced, the gross margin on each car will be reduced, and the company will be able to attain sustained profitability.

The most significant risk that I see with Tesla is an economic downturn that could significantly cut demand for these expensive vehicles (the ASP for a Model 3 is $50,000).

Take Away

TSLA shares fell over 13% today because of a big margin miss but the issue is not systemic. Restructuring cost having to do with the new Model Y as well as a one-time ASP cuts for old Model S and Model X played a significant role in the margin loss.

There is a significant amount of growth opportunities for this firm, and investors no longer need to be concerned about liquidity. I would not immediately jump into TSLA. The stock could fall further with the downward momentum behind it. Wait for the price to settle before getting in on the action.

Please keep in mind that TSLA is one of the most volatile stocks on the market and I caution you not to put a large position on.

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) took a hit on Thursday, falling as much as 14.8%. As of 1:08 p.m. EDT, the stock was down 14%.

The stock's slide follows the company's worse-than-expected second-quarter results and news that the chief technology officer, JB Straubel, is stepping down.

So what

For its second quarter, Tesla posted a non- GAAP (adjusted) loss per share of $1.12. On average, analysts were expecting a loss of $0.40. Notably, this loss was significantly narrower than an adjusted loss of $3.06 in the year-ago quarter.

Tesla's total revenue rose 59% year over year to $6.35 billion, driven primarily by a 134% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries. This was below analysts' consensus forecast for revenue of $6.41 billion.

The automaker also announced during its second-quarter earnings call that Straubel, who has been at the company 15 years and has played crucial roles in its battery technology, is stepping down. He will, however, serve in an advisory role.

Straubel asserted that the move is not because of a ""lack of confidence in the company or the team or anything like that.""

It's important to note that Tesla maintained its guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2019 to rise 45% to 65% year over year. In addition, management said it still expects to be profitable on a GAAP basis in Q3 and beyond."
118,0.9995,0.218,0.747,0.035,"After the closing bell on Wednesday, Tesla Motors (TSLA - Free Report) once again reported dismal quarterly results. The electric carmaker missed estimates on both fronts in the second quarter of 2019.
Adjusted loss per share was $1.12, much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 54 cents. The company had incurred loss of $3.06 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $6.35 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.38 billion but came in higher than the year-ago figure of $4 billion.
Earlier in July, Tesla revealed that it had produced record 87,048 vehicles (72,53 Model 3 and 14,517 Model S and Model X combined) during the quarter and delivered a record 95,200 (77,550 Model 3 and 17,650 Model S and X) vehicles, up 52% from the first quarter. The availability of Model 3 in the United Kingdom and continued interest from mainland Europe and China led to strong demand. Additionally, orders placed were more than deliveries, causing a spurt in order backlog in the ongoing third quarter (read: ).
Overall, Tesla continues to deliver 360,000-400,000 vehicles in 2019, indicating growth of 45-65% from 2018. It hopes to produce 500,000 vehicles a year globally in the 12-month period ending Jun 30, 2020 and reaffirmed a target of producing 10,000 vehicles per week by the end of 2019. The company also continues to target 25% non-GAAP gross margin on Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles.
Further, the company is likely to break even in the third quarter and return to profitability in the fourth quarter. Tesla remains on track to start local production of Model 3 in China by the end of the year and Model Y in Fremont by fall of 2020.
The wider-than-expected loss pushed down shares of Tesla by as much as 12% in aftermarket trading. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of F. It belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 35%).

120,0.9842,0.129,0.805,0.066,"Despite shipping and selling a record number of vehicles in Q2, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted another loss during the period. However, that loss was narrower than it was in the year-ago quarter, highlighting how the company is moving closer to profitability.

The quarterly update comes as Tesla continues to ramp up Model 3 deliveries as part of an effort to achieve greater economies of scale and ultimately become a self-funding company without the need to regularly tap into debt and equity markets for new capital.

Here are the key takeaways from the update.

Tesla's second-quarter results: The raw numbers

Tesla's total revenue in its second quarter increased 59% year over year to $6.3 billion, driven primarily by a 60% increase in automotive revenue. The lower revenue growth rate compared to Tesla's 134% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries was due to a lower average selling price for its vehicles. That's because the company's lower-cost Model 3 accounted for 81% of vehicle deliveries during the quarter, up from 45% in the year-ago period.

Both Tesla's net loss per share under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP (adjusted) loss per share narrowed. Its GAAP loss per share was $2.31, an improvement from a loss of $4.22 in the second quarter of 2018. Its non-GAAP loss per share was $1.12, narrower than a $3.06 non-GAAP loss per share in the year-ago quarter.

Though management didn't provide specific guidance for its earnings per share in Q2, it did say in its first-quarter shareholder letter that it didn't expect to be profitable until the second half of the year.

What management had to say

Management was pleased with its record vehicle production and deliveries during the quarter. ""This is an important milestone, as it represents rapid progress in managing global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes,"" Tesla said in its second-quarter shareholder letter.

The company also notably said it believes its business ""has grown to the point of being self-funding."" Though Tesla lost money on an accrual basis on its income statement during the period, the company was cash flow positive.

Highlights

Tesla generated $614 million of free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures).
Cash and cash equivalents were $5 billion, helped by positive cash flow and an equity and debt offering during the quarter.
Model 3 maintained an average selling price of $50,000 despite the introduction of lower-cost versions.
Model 3 production rates were at a record high in June.
Tesla's automotive gross margin was 18.9%.

Looking ahead

Tesla importantly maintained its full-year outlook 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries. Representing 45% to 65% year-over-year growth, this guidance shows how healthy the demand is for the electric-car maker's vehicles.

Management also reiterated its guidance for positive GAAP net income in Q3 and beyond. But Tesla emphasized that ""continuous volume growth, capacity expansion, and cash generation will remain the main focus."""
121,0.9806,0.089,0.883,0.028,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) came out with a quarterly loss of $1.12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.54. This compares to loss of $3.06 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -107.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric car maker would post a loss of $1.21 per share when it actually produced a loss of $2.90, delivering a surprise of -139.67%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

Tesla, which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, posted revenues of $6.35 billion for the quarter ended June 2019, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.41%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

Tesla shares have lost about 21.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 19.9%.

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Tesla was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.74 on $6.90 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$1.13 on $25.60 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Domestic is currently in the bottom 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1."
122,0.9801,0.094,0.864,0.043,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) is set to report second-quarter results on Jul 24, after market close. Elon Musk’s electric car company has for quite some time indicated a loss in the quarter despite its decision to sell emission credits to moderate a negative bottom line. Though analysts now expect Tesla to report a loss of $1.55 per share in the second quarter, they believe the company might swing back to its winning ways in either the third or fourth quarter.

Barclays PLC (BCS - Free Report) , which has an underweight rating, also expects the company to report a loss of 16 cents per share for the second quarter. But, what’s behind Tesla’s drab earnings picture? Tesla’s cash-cow models such as Model S and Model X are currently seeing weakening demand and the less-pricey Model 3 isn’t living up to expectations.

Lest we forget, Model 3’s gross margin dropped slightly in the first quarter. Model 3 had to face numerous hurdles pertaining to the launch of the product overseas. Tesla had to market the car in new markets like China since almost everyone in the United States with a taste for a flashy electric vehicle has bought Model 3.

However, Tesla may see an improvement in its Model 3 gross margin in the second quarter. After all, the vehicle’s delivery has soared 52% recently to a new quarterly high of 77,550 units. Tesla further explained that “we made significant progress streamlining our global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to our working capital position.”

Thanks to such an optimistic view, analysts now expect Tesla to report second-quarter revenues of roughly $6.4 billion, much higher than $4 billion reported a year ago.

There is another positive factor that may help Tesla post an encouraging revenue number — its competitive relevance in the pick-up truck market. Upstart Rivian has attracted major funding from some of the coveted names in corporate America. While Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN - Free Report) is expected to invest $700 million, Ford Motor Co. (F - Free Report) will shell out another $500 million. In case of Ford, the key motivation to invest in Rivian is the vehicle’s separate electric motor for each wheel.

Still, the electric car maker’s cash and cash equivalent position is not in a good shape. A bond payment of nearly $920 million bond payment in the first quarter coupled with a number of vehicles remaining in transit mode continues to dent the company’s cash position. Needless to say, Tesla’s cash and cash equivalents have declined from $3.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of last year to $2.2 billion at the end of the first quarter.

As a result, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has an Earnings ESP of -25.00%. This is Zacks’ proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

At the same time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s current-year earnings has trended downward over the past 60 days, as estimates slipped from a loss of 62 cents/share to a loss of $1.13/share right now.

Discouraging earnings performance, no doubt, will lead to a decline in the share price. Thus, the company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a negative 15%. In fact, Tesla has underperformed the broader Automotive - Domestic industry so far this year (-21.8% vs +6.4%).

123,0.9967,0.157,0.824,0.019,"With earnings season in full swing, a number of interesting earnings reports are on deck for this week. Three notable companies scheduled to report their latest quarterly earnings over the next few days include electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), e-commerce and cloud-computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and social network Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

Ahead of these three companies' earnings releases, here's a preview of some key items to watch when they report.

Tesla

Tesla continues to grow sales at a wild rate; it posted record quarterly vehicle deliveries earlier this month for its second quarter. Deliveries were up 134% year over year, driven by a surge in Model 3 production and sales. But questions still linger about the company's ability to move closer to regular profits. This is why investors will be watching Tesla's second-quarter earnings release closely.

Though management said in its first-quarter shareholder letter that it expected to be free cash flow positive in Q2, it didn't forecast to be profitable under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) until the second half of the year. Management did say, however, that it expected to see a significant reduction in its net loss during the quarter. It's no surprise, therefore, that analysts are calling for Tesla's non-GAAP (adjusted) loss per share during the period to come in at $0.43 -- an improvement from a loss of $2.90 per share in Q1.

Tesla will report its second-quarter results after market close on Wednesday, July 24.

Amazon

For Amazon, investors will be watching the company's revenue growth rate. The e-commerce and cloud-computing company's revenue growth has been decelerating recently, with its top line rising 17% year over year in Q1 -- down from 20% growth in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Management guided for second-quarter revenue between $59.5 billion and $63.5 billion, representing 13% to 20% year-over-year growth. Analysts, on average, expect the company's revenue to rise 18% year over year to $62.5 billion in Q2.

To get an even better gauge of the company's top-line strength, investors can look to management's guidance for its third-quarter revenue. This guidance may provide some insight into how well Prime Day impacted the period, as the 48-hour shopping holiday happened during the first month of the quarter.

Amazon reports its latest quarterly results after market close on Thursday, July 25.

Twitter

Two metrics to watch when Twitter reports earnings are its revenue and its growth in daily active users.

In Q1, Twitter's revenue increased 18% year over year, or 20% in constant currency. The company benefited from particular strength in the U.S., where management said ""continued execution across product and sales, coupled with broad-based advertiser demand"" helped advertising revenue in the domestic market rise 26% year over year. Did this momentum carry over to Q2?

Twitter also notably saw a reacceleration in its daily active users growth rate in Q1. Daily active users increased 11% year over year during the period -- up from 9% growth rates in the previous two quarters. Investors should look to see whether the company can maintain this elevated growth rate for the important metric.

124,0.994,0.116,0.841,0.043,"Earnings season is hitting the height of its excitement this week with the remaining FANG stocks (FB - Free Report) (AMZN - Free Report) (GOOGL - Free Report) reporting as well as one of my personal favorite quarterly reports, Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) . TSLA is a big mover on earnings reports with an average move of 7.8%. Unfortunately, 6 of the last 10 earnings had a negative impact. Expectations have significantly dropped since Tesla’s Q1 report was released and I believe that analysts’ Q2 estimates are conservative.

Tesla is releasing its earnings after the bell on July 23 rd, and analysts are anticipating strong sales growth combined with an improved bottom-line loss. Q2 EPS estimates current sit at a $0.54 loss per share and estimated sales are $6.38 billion, which would represent a significant loss improvement and 59% revenue growth year-over-year.

Tesla and its ostentatious CEO Elon Musk like to keep its investors on their toes, with estimates being historically misguided, frustrating both sell-side analysts and investors. This is the primary reason that earnings have caused big moved to TSLA’s price in past earnings reports.

The first 5 months of 2019, TSLA lost over 46% of its value due to liquidity concerns. Investors didn’t know if Tesla was going to be able to make it through 2019 at its cash burn rate.

In May, Tesla was able to successfully raise more than $2 billion in a combined convertible bond and seasoned equity offering (SEO), in which Elon Musk himself bought $25 million worth of shares. This surge in funding eased investors’ liquidity concerns and gave the stock a good boost starting in June (almost a month after the offering). TSLA is up 45% since the beginning of June.

TSLA is one of the most volatile stocks on the market. It is currently trading at $259.87, having been as high as $387 and as low as $177 over the past 52 weeks.

Above you can see TSLA’s 4-year chart where the red line represents the $250 price level that has worked as both a support and a resistance level. We are currently riding this inflection point, and the earnings release after close on Wednesday is going to dictate whether TSLA bounces off or surges through this price level.

Consumer Shift to Cheaper Tesla

The WSJ looked at California’s new Tesla registrations for Q2. California is the largest market for electric vehicles (EV), making up almost half of the US’s total EV sales. The data showed that the Golden State natives were purchasing far less high-end Tesla like the Model S and Model X with registrations down 54% and 40% respectively. On the other hand, Model 3 registrations were up almost 100% in Q2.

This is an illustration of how Tesla’s topline is expected to be driven moving forward, higher volume but lower-margin sales. What to look for in this upcoming earnings report is whether the additional Model 3’s sold can make up the decline in both the Model S and X.

Take Away

Tesla’s immediate future is quite uncertain, but I believe that this firm has strong long term potential. Gigafactory 3, being built outside of Shanghai, is ahead of schedule and Musk is anticipating a lofty production target of 3,000 vehicles per week by the end of this year. China is the world’s largest EV market by far, being driven by government incentives. Competition is steep, but I believe that once Tesla’s are domestically made in China, demand will surge. I discuss this in more detail in my article, Tesla Is Charged And Ready To Drive Returns.

Tesla’s exciting earnings release is something to pay attention to even if you do not own the stock. Look for margin changes as the firm transitions to a higher volume, lower margin business model, with scale being the driving forces moving forward.

Look for any changes in management guidance on China operations as well as domestic. Bear in mind that guidance has historically been erroneous, though it can still shift market sentiment. With negative earnings expected, a significant topline beat could give TSLA investors some short-term gains.

125,0.9993,0.154,0.83,0.015,"As U.S. markets continue to flirt with all-time highs, it can seem daunting to find stocks positioned for huge growth and returns over the next decade. Because it's difficult to uncover these well-positioned stocks, three Motley Fool contributors have ideas that you should dig into: JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Here's why.

An e-commerce powerhouse

Jeremy Bowman (JD.com): One of the biggest growth opportunities in the world today is in Chinese e-commerce. Despite a slowing growth rate, China's GDP is still expanding more than twice as fast as that of the U.S., and is set to displace this country as the world's biggest economy in the next 10 to 20 years.

Meanwhile, online retail is even more popular in China than it is here because the country is already the world's biggest e-commerce market, and JD.com is a major reason why.

JD is China's biggest online retailer by revenue since it operates both as a direct seller and as a marketplace, much like Amazon.com. The company has also built a network of more than 550 warehouses across China and operates its own delivery and logistics service, allowing it to deliver 90% of customer orders in one day or less.

Recently, the company opened up its delivery network to individual customers, which can now send parcels themselves through JD, opening up another revenue stream. And it is aggressively investing in technology like drone delivery and automation to strengthen its leadership in e-commerce, logistics, and delivery, and expand its reach in rural China.

In its most recent quarter, revenue rose 20.9% to $18 billion, while sales at its services segment, which includes its marketplace and third-party logistics and delivery services, rose 44% to $1.9 billion, showing that the company is growing its core business at a strong rate and transitioning to higher-margin services, which helped double its adjusted operating profit margin last quarter to 1.6%.

With the secular growth in China's online retail market ahead of it, JD's strong position as the leading direct seller in China, and its fast-growing service businesses, the company looks poised for huge growth over the next several years. At a price-to-sales ratio of less than 1, the stock is much cheaper than most online retailers, making it an appealing buy today.

A driverless juggernaut

Daniel Miller (Aptiv): If you're looking for a stock with upside over the next decade, look no further than Aptiv, a provider of software, electronics, and technology dedicated to developing the next generation of driverless vehicles and smart cities. Despite its long-term potential to thrive as the race toward driverless cars intensifies, weak 2019 guidance and slowing light-vehicle sales have pushed the company's consensus forward P/E to a modest 16 times.

Aptiv may not be a household name to many investors, but its technologies continue to gain accolades. One example: in June, Aptiv, in collaboration with Audi, won the 2019 CLEPA Innovation Award (from an association of European auto parts suppliers) for its Automated Driving Satellite Compute Platform.

In April, Aptiv was presented by Automotive News with a 2019 PACE Award (recognizing suppliers for game-changing innovations) for that same platform. Oh, and that was the 21st time Aptiv has been recognized with a PACE award.

Beyond its technologies, the company is continuing to expand its overall strategy with its recent opening of the China Autonomous Mobility Center. China has a high market acceptance of driverless vehicles, and with the government's strong push for electric vehicles, the world's largest automotive market will be a perfect place to develop and test driverless technology.

While a mainstream driverless future remains in the distance, Aptiv and its partnership with Lyft have already logged well over 30,000 paid automated rides, with a 4.95-star rating out of 5 -- proving people will pay for the service. If you're looking for a stock poised for huge growth, finding one like Aptiv that's positioned to thrive on an upcoming megatrend is a great place to start.

Optionality galore

Brian Feroldi (Tesla): Tesla is one of the most divisive companies that I've ever seen. Bulls believe that it's only a matter of time before its products completely take over both the auto and energy markets. Bears believe that this company is always on the verge of bankruptcy.

While I see plenty of reasons to be both bullish and bearish, I think that the auto and energy markets will go through truly disruptive change in the 2020s. The economics of switching to electric vehicles and solar have become very compelling, which bodes well for Tesla's continued growth.

Its near- and long-term product road map also offers investors plenty of reasons for optimism. The Model 3 rollout is still ramping up and should remain strong as it spreads to a more international market. The same goes for Powerwall, Powerpack, and its solar roof, all of which have been put on the back burner because of challenges with its Model 3 ramp up.

Meanwhile, it also has plans for a semi truck, next-generation roadster, pickup truck, Model Y, and bus within the next few years. While success is never guaranteed, the company's products have historically sold well right out of the gate since it is so good at generating buzz ahead of their launch.

Finally, Elon Musk has stated that its fleet of 1 million autonomous ridesharing vehicles will come online next year. Tesla's history shows that the timeline is probably overly ambitious, but if the company can be first to market with a fleet of autonomous vehicles, then it could generate a huge amount of shareholder wealth.

This stock isn't for the faint of heart, but the 2020s are poised to be an amazing decade for the business. If everything goes according to plan, then Tesla's stock could earn investors multibagger returns from here. That's why I've committed a small amount of my capital to it and plan on holding it no matter what headlines come out next."
126,0.9746,0.141,0.772,0.087,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors will get a timely update into the company's business this week. The electric-car maker will report its second-quarter financial results after market close on Wednesday, July 24. With the quarterly update taking place during a time of rapid growth for Tesla, investors will be looking to see how soaring Model 3 deliveries are impacting the company's financials.

A number of items will be worth checking on when Tesla reports its results, but three areas will be especially important: Model 3 gross margin, cash and cash equivalents, and management's third-quarter vehicle deliveries guidance.

1. Model 3 gross margin

Tesla's Model 3 gross margin dipped slightly in Q1, falling from ""above 20%"" in Q4 to approximately 20%. The sequential pullback in the vehicle's gross margin wasn't surprising, as Model 3 deliveries declined 20% sequentially amid challenges with launching the new vehicle in overseas markets for the first time.

In Tesla's second quarter, however, investors should look for an improvement in Model 3 gross margin since the vehicle's deliveries surged 52% sequentially to a new quarterly high of 77,550 units. Notably, Tesla said in its second-quarter update on vehicle deliveries that it saw efficiency gains during the period, suggesting a gross margin improvement is likely.

""In addition, we made significant progress streamlining our global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to our working capital position,"" Tesla explained.

But if Tesla's Model 3 gross margin does improve sequentially in Q2, it may only be a small improvement. Sales from the introduction of Tesla's cheaper, standard-range Model 3 at the end of Q1 could offset some improvements in gross margin achieved from higher delivery volumes.

2. Cash and cash equivalents

A $920 million bond repayment during Q1 and the costs from having a higher number of vehicles in transit amid Tesla's overseas expansion weighed on the company's cash position during the period. Its total cash and cash equivalents fell from $3.7 billion at the end of Q4 to $2.2 billion at the end of Q1.

Tesla's cash position should improve significantly in Q2 since the company raised $$2.7 billion of capital during the quarter by offering both debt and equity. In addition, management's forecast for positive free cash flow in Q2 bodes well for the metric.

3. Vehicle deliveries guidance

Last but certainly not least, investors should look for management's guidance for third-quarter vehicle deliveries. With Tesla announcing another price cut for its vehicles earlier this month, there's reason to wonder whether demand going into the second half of the year is as robust as management had hoped it would be.

In its second-quarter update on vehicle production and deliveries, Tesla said an increase in its order backlog going into Q3 meant the company was well positioned to grow deliveries during the quarter. Will management maintain this outlook?

Stay tuned for Tesla's quarterly update on Wednesday."

128,0.9962,0.156,0.794,0.049,"Stocks drifted lower last week as investors digested dozens of reports from the start of second-quarter earnings season. Both the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) shed less than 1% to hold near their highs for the year.

Hundreds of companies will post second-quarter earnings results over the coming week, which could mean volatility ahead for the broader market. Below, we'll take a look at the metrics that could send shares of iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) moving over the next few trading days.

iRobot's outlook

Investors have been down on iRobot's stock since the company's first-quarter report in late April. That announcement included some potential warning flags with the company's business, including slowing sales growth, declining profitability, and a surge in inventory.

Executives said at the time that these issues didn't reflect demand struggles but instead were powered by temporary disruptions due to tariff-related cost increases and the shift toward shipping newer Roomba devices. By watching to see if sales and pricing trends returned to a double-digit growth pace, investors will find out on Tuesday whether that bullish reading played out during the quarter.

Looking further out, CEO Colin Angle and his team should have a better grasp on the 2019 outlook, especially following the Amazon Prime shopping day that prominently featured iRobot devices. A strong showing online might give executives confidence to affirm the full-year outlook that calls for about 18% higher sales in 2019.

Coca-Cola's volumes

There are good reasons to expect weaker sales results from Coca-Cola on Tuesday as compared to PepsiCo 's recent report. Coke is more exposed to the sluggish demand trends around soda drinks, for example. The beverage giant also noted last quarter that its unusually high organic sales growth was in part due to a timing issue that brought orders in the first quarter -- which means gains will likely be closer to 3% than 5% in Q2.

Coke has been keeping overall revenue marching higher, thanks to rising average prices and strong demand in niches like sports drinks and water. That success, plus aggressive cost-cutting, has been enough to power healthy profits. However, investors likely won't reward the stock with market-beating returns until the company can show more robust sales volumes in the sparkling-beverage segment that accounts for the majority of annual sales.

Tesla's profitability

Tesla reports its second-quarter results on Wednesday, and all the ingredients are present for a potentially explosive response by Wall Street. After all, shares have been especially volatile lately, cratering from highs over $350 per share but also rebounding sharply from an early June low of $200 per share.

The latest rally was powered by news that the company delivered just under 100,000 vehicles during the second quarter, including nearly 80,000 of its flagship Model 3 automobile. Production rates also improved sharply, which bodes well for future sales -- assuming the company can move closer toward profitability for its full lineup.

Tesla said in early July that demand still exceeds supply for the Model 3, and investors will get more details on that exact balance in this week's report. But Wall Street's focus will mostly be on the automaker's profitability, given that operating loss passed a painful $700 million in the fiscal first quarter."
129,-0.9759,0.068,0.83,0.102,"Earlier this month, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported that it delivered a record 95,200 vehicles during the second quarter, bouncing back from a dreadful start to the year. (Deliveries totaled just 63,000 in the first quarter.) It also said that its order backlog increased last quarter. While Tesla hasn't released its full quarterly earnings report yet, this update seemed to indicate that the electric vehicle pioneer was getting itself back on track.

However, Tesla rolled out yet another series of price cuts and options adjustments earlier this week. This renews questions about the strength of demand. Furthermore, these changes could have other negative short-term and long-term impacts on Tesla's business.

Another price cut

In the latest update to its lineup, Tesla dropped the standard-range versions of the Model S and Model X again, after reintroducing them earlier this year. It has also reduced the price of the long-range variants. On balance, this means that the entry-level Model S price is about $5,000 higher in the U.S. today than it was a week ago. The increase was about $4,000 for the Model X. Customers buying the pricier performance package now get ""Ludicrous Mode"" included, rather than having to pay $20,000 extra for that option.

The price of the cheapest Model 3 variant available for online ordering decreased by $1,000 to $38,990. (The $35,000 base model is still available ""off-menu"" by phone.) The prices of several other options (or option packages) have been adjusted as well -- downwards, for the most part.

Tesla explained these moves as follows: ""We are also adjusting our pricing in order to continue to improve affordability for customers. Like other car companies, we periodically adjust pricing and available options.""

In reality, Tesla is changing its pricing and options at an unprecedented clip. By mid-March, it had already implemented four price changes this year, and there have been more adjustments since then. These frequent pricing changes are bad news for Tesla bulls.

Margin pressure is likely to continue

The most obvious risk for Tesla is that its price cuts will undermine its profitability. Tesla posted an ugly $702 million net loss in Q1 2019 after being solidly profitable in the second half of 2018. Automotive gross margin, excluding zero-emission vehicle credits and stock-based compensation, fell to 20.3% in the first quarter from 24.7% a quarter earlier.

The sharp drop in Tesla's deliveries drove part of that decline. However, Tesla acknowledged that price reductions and an unfavorable mix shift also contributed to its gross margin erosion.

The unfavorable mix shift continued last quarter, as the company began delivering the cheapest version of the Model 3 and sales of the pricier Model S and Model X continued to plunge. Price changes also put downward pressure on gross margin. As a result, most analysts believe that Tesla lost money in Q2 despite delivering a record number of vehicles.

It's true that in the latest round of adjustments, the entry-level prices for the Model S and Model X increased significantly. However, those starting prices are actually just $790 higher than they were in late April -- only customers are now getting a long-range battery rather than a standard battery for roughly the same price. That's great for buyers, but bad for Tesla's profitability.

Tesla is confusing -- and angering -- its customers

The endless stream of price changes this year is also having a more subtle negative impact on Tesla. For many years, the company distinguished itself from traditional automakers by not discounting its cars. As a result, customers could feel confident that they were getting a fair price when buying a Tesla, even though they were shelling out a lot of cash.

Today, with prices seeming to change every month -- sometimes dramatically -- customers don't know what the ""fair"" price is for any given Tesla vehicle. One recent repeat buyer was furious after Tesla staff urged him to buy his fully loaded Model 3 before the federal electric vehicle tax credit fell by $1,875 on July 1. He followed their advice -- but then Tesla cut the price of his car by more than $6,000 last week.

In the short run, highlighting an upcoming tax credit drop to drive sales and then cutting prices shortly after the tax credit declines to boost sales further is actually a clever way to sell more cars. But in the long run, the effects might not be so positive. In addition to angering customers who find that they overpaid, Tesla is confusing potential future buyers about what to expect with regard to pricing.

This could hurt sales in two ways. Potential buyers who expect further price cuts may hold out for those price cuts to materialize before ordering a vehicle. The expectation that prices will keep falling will also hurt trade-in values and drive up lease rates for Teslas.

Tesla needs to slow down

Falling battery costs and increasing economics of scale should allow Tesla to reduce its costs over time -- perhaps quite significantly. The company's ongoing moves to streamline its vehicle lineup will also reduce its costs by simplifying production. As a result, in the long run, Tesla should be able to turn a profit even with lower prices.

However, Tesla appears to be cutting prices too quickly relative to its cost reductions. Moreover, it has turned pricing into a game, which could confuse potential customers and even anger people who valued the company's no-haggle pricing policy. As a result, Tesla still has more work to do to stabilize its business."

131,0.9887,0.104,0.851,0.045,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is one of the most volatile stocks trading in the US today. It lost almost 50% of its value in the first 5 months of the year due to concerns about liquidity, then rebounded over 40% since the beginning of June. The rebound was caused by the surge in capital from a seasoned equity offering (SEO) it had in May, which eased liquidity concerns. This stock has a mind of its own and doesn’t appear to follow any broader index. I believe that TSLA has the momentum to break through this $250 level and reach new highs.

The key catalyst for my buy recommendation includes eased liquidity concern from the SEO and the ahead of schedule Gigafactory 3 in China that could make Tesla the #1 electronic vehicle provider in the country. The company is estimated to show strong profitability by 2020, and sales are expected to grow exponentially over the next 3 years.

Momentum is on TSLA’s side, and I am confident that it will continue if the firm is able to show robust financials in the upcoming earnings report on Wednesday, July 24 th. TSLA is a big mover on earnings with an average price change 7.8% over the past 10 earnings releases.

China Exposure

Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 is underway outside of Shanghai, expecting to start production in November. The factory will produce battery cells as well as Model 3s and Model Ys with an initial run-rate target of producing 250,000 vehicles and a 500,000 vehicle capacity annually.

An estimated 35,000-40,000 vehicles are expected to be produced in 2020 and could produce up to 60,000 EVs by 2021, according to Morgan Stanely. Tesla’s ostentatious CEO Elon Musk, is aiming to produce 3,000 Model 3s per week by the end of 2019.

China is the largest market for electronic vehicles in the world with government incentives stimulating this space. The EV market in China is extremely competitive but analysts believe that once Tesla’s are domestically made the demand will spike.

Valuation

The first valuation metric that I am going to use is the 12-month forward EV/EBITDA, which is a good multiple for firms with a lot of debt, which Telsa is primarily financed by. TSLA is trading at 13.8x EV/EBITDA, the lowest end of this metric’s 5-year trend, having traded as high as 86.8x and as low as 10.9x.

TSLA is also trading at a 1.5x forward P/S which is also at the lowest end of its 5-year trend, having a range of 7x to 1.1x. There is no good comparison for this revolutionary firm, so comparing it back to its own trends is the best way for me to analyze relative value. From these metrics, it appears that TSLA could be trading at discounted multiples.

US automakers Ford (F - Free Report) , General Motors (GM - Free Report) , and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU - Free Report) are trading at much lower mutliples because they are unable to achieve the same growth or gross margins.

Take Away

Tesla is one of those companies that everyone wants to succeed (unless you have a short position) because it symbolizes not only a cultural shift towards a cleaner world but a drive to reach levels of innovation that humans never thought was possible.

This stock is driving north at discounted valuations that investors haven’t seen TSLA trade at before. Gigafactory 3 is going to drive Tesla’s topline exponentially being located in EV’s highest demanding country. I just bought this stock today at $250 and plan on selling at $350, a level this stock has struggled to break through. Some analysts are setting price targets as high as $400.

132,0.9939,0.121,0.821,0.058,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) reports results for the quarter ended June 2019. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 24, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

This electric car maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +81.7%.

Revenues are expected to be $6.38 billion, up 59.3% from the year-ago quarter.

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 97.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tesla?

For Tesla, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -33.10%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tesla would post a loss of $1.21 per share when it actually produced a loss of $2.90, delivering a surprise of -139.67%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Tesla doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."
133,0.9246,0.103,0.84,0.057,"Though Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already announced how many vehicles it delivered in its second quarter, the company's financial performance during the period is still a big mystery. Sure, the electric-car maker delivered more vehicles than in any quarter in its history. But this doesn't mean it performed well financially during the period. Indeed, the average analyst estimate calls for negative non- GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.52.

Investors, however, will get a better feel for Tesla's second-quarter performance soon. The company just scheduled its earnings report for after market close on Wednesday, July 24. Investors will be looking for insight into a range of key items, including free cash flow, gross profit margin, management's full-year outlook for vehicle deliveries, and more.

Here's a preview of what to expect from some of these metrics.

Free cash flow

Tesla's profitability in the second half of 2018 was short-lived. After posting positive free cash flow of $881 million and $910 million in the third and fourth quarter of last year, respectively, the important profitability metric plummeted in Q1. Free cash flow during the period was negative $920 million as Tesla's overseas expansion of Model 3 deliveries during the period proved costly.

For the second quarter, management said it expected to return to positive free cash flow, but it won't be until Q3 that the company expects to have positive net income.

Automotive gross margin

As deliveries fell sequentially in Q1, Tesla's automotive gross margin declined, falling from 24.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 20.2%. This metric should see improvement in Q2, though, thanks to record deliveries during the quarter. Tesla delivered 95,200 vehicles in Q2, driven by soaring Model 3 deliveries.

While Tesla didn't provide any specific guidance for its second-quarter gross margin, management did say in its first-quarter shareholder letter that it continues ""to target a 25% non-GAAP gross margin on Model S, Model X and Model 3, depending on variant mix and option take rates as our product offerings change.""

Full-year outlook

Finally, investors will want to look to see whether Tesla maintains its full-year outlook for vehicle deliveries.

Going into 2019, the automaker said it expected to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year, representing 45% to 65% year-over-year growth. Despite delivering fewer-than-expected vehicles in Q1, Tesla reiterated its this outlook in its first-quarter shareholder letter. With half of the year in the rearview mirror, will Tesla maintain this forecast again?

Since second-quarter deliveries of over 95,000 vehicles were slightly above the midpoint of management's 90,000-100,000 forecast, it will likely stick to its guidance once again."
134,0.993,0.131,0.855,0.014,"Many companies will be reporting earnings in the coming weeks. While reports from megacap stocks like Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft will see lots of coverage in the media following their quarterly updates this month, three smaller and faster-growing companies will be worth watching as well. These companies are Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN). Each of these businesses boasts soaring revenue.

Given their premium valuations, these growth stocks could see their shares make big movies in either direction after their earnings releases. Ahead of their reports, here's a quick look at some key metrics to watch.

Tesla

Electric-car maker Tesla has already revealed its second-quarter deliveries. The automaker delivered a record 77,550 Model 3 units and 17,650 combined Model S and X units. This put total deliveries at 95,200, up 134% year over year. While the record figure was higher than analysts were expecting, the company's financial performance during the quarter is still unclear.

Analyst estimates for Tesla's non- GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share range from a loss of $1.52 to a profit of $0.50. For what it's worth, Tesla management's guidance provided in its first-quarter shareholder letter didn't call for the company to return to profitability until Q3. The consensus analyst estimate for an adjusted loss of $0.52 per share, therefore, is a good barometer for what to expect from the key metric.

Tesla is scheduled to report its second-quarter results after market close on July 24.

Atlassian

Shareholders of productivity software provider Atlassian will likely be eyeing the company's revenue growth rate. Though the company's 38% year-over-year revenue growth in its fiscal third quarter was strong, it was a slight deceleration from 39.3% revenue growth in fiscal Q2.

Management guided for its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to be between $329 to $331 million, implying about 35% year-over-year growth. Analysts, on average, expect Atlassian's revenue to come in at the high end of this guidance range.

Atlassian will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results after market close on July 25.

Zendesk

Online customer service platform Zendesk kicked off fiscal 2019 with robust revenue growth. Its top line surged 40% year over year, fueled by broad-based strength, including healthy growth from small and mid-sized businesses and more traction with large customers.

Investors should check to see if Zendesk is still seeing outsize growth from large customers. Customers with 100 or more Zendesk Support agents represented 40% of annual recurring revenue in Q1, up from 38% in the year-ago period and 25% in the first quarter of 2015.

Zendesk will report its second-quarter results after market close on July 30."

Notably, in second-quarter 2019, the electric vehicle maker registered a record number of deliveries. After several job cuts in the past year, the company has reversed its stance. Its decision to increase production indicates that it is confident about the sustainability in demand for Model 3 vehicles.
Notably, in second-quarter 2019, the company posted record 95,200 Model 3 deliveries. However, during the same time frame, it delivered total 17,650 Model S sedans and Model X crossovers, down 21% year over year. In fact, the record sedan delivery is aiding the company to overcome waning Model S sales.

136,0.9805,0.087,0.902,0.011,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is ""making preparations"" for higher production at its car factory in Fremont, California, the company's automotive president, Jerome Guillen, said in a leaked email (via Bloomberg) this week. Guillen, however, refrained from providing specifics as to why Tesla expects to increase output, suggesting the automaker may have a surprise in store.

The email, which also included some upbeat news on the company's recent production levels, arrived in the news at a moment when the electric-car company is achieving record sales, and aiming for even higher delivery numbers in the second half of the year.

Mysterious ""upcoming developments""

Regarding Tesla's ""preparations"" to increase output in Fremont, Guillen wrote, ""While we can't be too specific in this email, I know you will be delighted with the upcoming developments.""

In addition, he told employees that the company is hiring. ""As we continue to ramp up production, please tell your friends and neighbors that we have lots of exciting new positions open, both in Fremont and at [the Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada],"" the executive wrote in the email.

The executive's reference to a hiring spree suggests the news could be meaningful -- though it could be mostly related to Tesla's current operations as it continues to accelerate Model 3 production.

Early production of a new vehicle is a possible (but unlikely) explanation for the expected output increase. Tesla wasn't planning on shipping the first Model Y SUVs until fall of next year. In addition, Tesla said in its first-quarter earnings call in April that production of its all-electric semi-truck won't start until sometime in 2020.

Getting to 360,000 deliveries

Guillen also offered praise for the company's second-quarter production achievements, noting that Tesla ""hit new records in all production lines for output and efficiency."" In addition, he said quality at both its car factory and battery factory is ""reaching record highs.""

The combination of his optimism and Tesla's higher-than-expected Q2 deliveries suggests the electric-car maker is on track to hit its full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries -- a growth range of 45% to 65%. So far this year, Tesla has delivered 158,000 vehicles, with about 95,000 of those deliveries occurring during Q2. To hit the low end of its 2019 outlook, Tesla will need to deliver more than 200,000 vehicles during the second half of the year."
137,0.9985,0.196,0.768,0.036,"Awards and praise are stacking up for Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3. Last December, Detroit's own Detroit News crowned the Model 3 the ""vehicle of the year."" And earlier this month, Model 3 earned a five-star safety rating from the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP), building on a five-star rating by U.S.-based National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) last September. Now the U.K.'s automotive website Auto Express is naming Tesla's Model 3 the ""Car of the Year for 2019.""

Impressive safety ratings and glowing reviews could help bolster demand for Tesla's Model 3 as the company aims for another round of record vehicle deliveries in Q3.

Safety

Last week, Euro NCAP awarded Model 3 not just a five-star all-around safety rating, but five stars in all four of the test's categories. The categories, Tesla said in a blog post, ""evaluate a car's ability to protect adults, children, vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians, as well as its safety assistance features.""

The Euro NCAP's ""safety assist"" category is unique in that it is one of the few programs with comprehensive testing of the latest driver-assist technology, like Tesla's Autopilot. On this front, Euro NCAP had some good news for Tesla.

""In this latter 'Safety Assist' category, which evaluates a car's active safety features including its ability to avoid accidents, mitigate injuries and prevent drivers from unintentionally drifting out of their lane,"" Tesla said in a blog post, ""Model 3 earned the highest score that Euro NCAP has awarded to date under their 2018/2019 testing protocols.""

The Model 3 similarly passed NHTSA's safety tests with flying colors last year. The vehicle earned an overall five-star rating, a five-star rating in every category and sub-category, and bragging rights of having the lowest probability of injury of every car the agency has ever tested.

Performance

This week, Auto Express weighed in on the Model 3's overall performance and specs, dubbing the vehicle the best car of 2019. The website praised the vehicle's range, torque, passenger capacity, simple design, handling, and support for 200-kilowatt-hour charging capacity.

""[The Model 3] distills the Tesla qualities we love into a smaller and more affordable package, and will cement its maker as a dominant force in the global car market,"" Auto Express tweeted on Tuesday.

Model 3 deliveries hit a record high in Q2, surging 320% year over year and 52% sequentially, helping total vehicle deliveries set a new record. Going into Q3, Tesla said it expects total deliveries to rise further. The Model 3, of course, will likely play a key role in this growth.

Not all feedback on the Model 3, however, has been positive. Consumer product rating agency Consumer Reports pulled its recommendation on the Model 3 earlier this year, citing reliability issues. But Tesla objected to CR 's critique, saying the survey was based on Model 3 vehicles delivered no later than September of last year. ""[T]he vast majority of these issues have already been corrected through design and manufacturing improvements, and we are already seeing a significant improvement in our field data,"" Tesla said in a statement to press.

Whether CR recommends Model 3 in the future or not, consumers are eager to get their hands on the new vehicle, as well as Tesla's Models S and X. The company said total orders for its vehicles in Q2 were greater than its deliveries during the quarter, highlighting strong demand and setting Tesla up for a good shot at yet another record quarter."
138,0.9759,0.09,0.858,0.052,"While most of the attention regarding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has recently been on the company's Model 3, Tesla's older and pricier models are still critical to the company's success. Sure, the Model 3 now accounts for about 80% of the automaker's quarterly deliveries, but the Model S and X still have fatter margins, making them an important element in the company's ongoing expansion.

To help reinvigorate sales of the two vehicles after they pulled back sharply earlier this year, some investors have been hoping the automaker would release refreshed versions of the vehicles. But investors shouldn't get their hopes up. There currently aren't any plans for a refresh, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter this week.

What you see is what you get

When asked on Twitter on Monday when a Model X refresh is coming, Musk responded, saying, ""There is no 'refreshed' Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes."" For the most part, therefore, what potential customers see today is what they get.

But Tesla will continue with its practice of continually updating its vehicles with beneath-the-surface changes that make its vehicles better over time. ""[The] most significant change in [the] past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit,"" Musk continued in his tweet. ""That went into production 3 months ago.""

This contrasts with speculation in the hyperactive Tesla rumor mill about some major upcoming updates to the vehicles. Last summer, Electrek reported that Tesla was planning to overhaul the interior of the Model S and X, including a more spartan look and new display akin to the Model 3's interior. While interior changes are still possible, they might not be as significant as imagined. In addition, they may be introduced more gradually instead of all at once.

Of course, it's difficult to know what Musk considers a ""refresh."" Perhaps interior changes would qualify as part of ""a series of minor ongoing changes."" But with Musk explicitly warning that a major refresh isn't in the works, investors certainly shouldn't have high expectations for physical design changes in the near future.

Is a refresh really necessary?

While a meaningful refresh to the Model S and X vehicles' design would likely bolster demand for the cars, it's not yet clear whether demand for the two models is really suffering. Sure, combined Model S and X deliveries plummeted 56% sequentially in Q1. But this was at least partly expected; the automaker pushed as many deliveries as possible to the fourth quarter of 2018 so customers could tap into the full federal electric vehicle tax credit before it was cut in half. Further, sales of the two models have already picked up substantially. Tesla delivered 17,650 Model S and X combined in Q2, up from about 12,000 in Q1.

To be fair, second-quarter Model S and X deliveries were still down 21% year over year. But it may not be until Tesla's first-quarter slump is several quarters in the rearview mirror before investors see whether the period was more of a one-time whiff or indicative of declining demand for the two models.

Nevertheless, Tesla will still need to at least keep up its method of constantly improving its vehicles with a series of smaller changes that -- hopefully -- add up to big enough changes to keep Model S and X deliveries from falling further."
139,0.9886,0.096,0.848,0.056,"After a shockingly weak first quarter, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) faced a lot of pressure to get things moving in the right direction again in the second quarter.

On Tuesday afternoon, it followed through, reporting a quarterly record for deliveries. It increased its order backlog during the quarter as well, indicating that order activity has bounced back from a weak start to 2019. That should help restore some investor confidence in Elon Musk's company. Still, it is likely to report a sizable loss for the quarter -- and it's not clear yet if the uptick in orders is sustainable.

A much stronger quarter for Tesla

In the first quarter of this year, Tesla's orders, production, and deliveries plummeted relative to the final quarter of 2018. Most notably, it delivered just 63,000 vehicles, down by 31% from the previous quarter. That included a horrendous drop exceeding 50% for the more-lucrative Model S and Model X.

As expected, Tesla turned things around in the second quarter. And the improvement in its order and delivery numbers was even greater than what most Wall Street analysts had expected.

It says that it delivered approximately 95,200 vehicles last quarter, topping the record of 90,700 set two quarters earlier. Furthermore, orders exceeded deliveries, leading the company to conclude, ""We believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3.""

Production significantly lagged deliveries during the quarter, as it built 87,048 vehicles. That's great news from a cash-flow perspective, as it meant that it exited the quarter with less inventory and fewer vehicles in transit to customers. However, it does raise the question of whether the company still faces supply constraints that could prevent it from meeting its growth targets.

The news wasn't all good

While the delivery update had plenty of good news for investors, there were still a couple of red flags.

First, the Model S and Model X combined for 17,650 deliveries last quarter. That represents an improvement over the first quarter, when Tesla delivered just 12,100 Model S and Model X vehicles, but it's still far below the 22,300 delivered in Q2 2018. Competition from the lower-priced Model 3 appears to be sapping demand for the Model S and Model X, which is bad news because those models produce far more profit than the Model 3.

And while the company surpassed analysts' estimates by delivering 95,200 vehicles last quarter, this performance was right in the middle of its own guidance range for 90,000 to 100,000 deliveries. That gives Tesla 158,200 deliveries for the first half of 2019. It will need to deliver more than 200,000 cars in the second half of the year just to meet the low end of its full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries. So it needs to ramp up orders, production, and deliveries even beyond Q2 levels to achieve its full-year targets.

Will performance get better or worse?

While Tesla was profitable in the second half of 2018, it's doubtful that the company turned a profit last quarter, despite achieving a record delivery total. Not only did it deliver about 10,000 fewer Model S and Model X units than it did in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, but the company is also delivering a much less favorable mix of the Model 3. Last year, Model 3 deliveries tilted toward heavily optioned versions priced at nearly $60,000 on average. By contrast, Tesla began delivering the $35,000 base model a few months ago.

Thus, it needs to grow even more or lower its costs to reach breakeven. Yet just repeating the Q2 delivery performance could be challenging. The surge in demand last quarter may have been driven partly by the launch of the Model 3 outside North America, as well as the initial availability of the $35,000 version in the U.S. The reduction of the federal tax credit for Tesla purchases from $3,750 to $1,875 that took effect on July 1 also likely spurred demand.

Those tailwinds won't exist this quarter. There's a risk that the tax credit reduction pulled some demand forward into the second quarter, in parallel with what happened six months earlier.

On the other hand, it's possible that the rebound in order activity last quarter reflects increasing interest in electric cars -- and Teslas in particular. Additionally, Tesla hopes to open a new factory in China before the end of 2019, which will allow it to dramatically lower its prices in the world's largest electric vehicle market. That could pave the way for massive sales growth there.

In short, while the strong Q2 delivery report is a step in the right direction, bulls shouldn't take a victory lap quite yet. Tesla seemed to have turned the corner toward profitability in the second half of 2018 before falling deep into the red again to begin 2019. It still needs to show that the uptick in order activity seen during Q2 will last, even as electric vehicle subsidies continue to fall, enabling the company to reach sustainable profitability."
140,0.9833,0.118,0.835,0.047,"When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced its quarterly vehicle deliveries last week, the media seemed to be mainly focused on the quarter's Model 3 sales -- which, of course, is fair. Since the vehicle now accounts for the bulk of Tesla's total vehicle deliveries, investors have good reason to keep an eye on the important car's sales trends.

But there's another key takeaway from the update beyond the Model 3's record sales: Model S and X rebounded nicely from a first-quarter slump. The sequential jump in Model S and X deliveries highlights the two vehicles' sales resilience, even as Model 3 deliveries soar.

Model S and X deliveries rise

A quick glance at Tesla's second-quarter vehicle deliveries would make any positive takeaway regarding Model S and X sales trends easy to look over. Total deliveries were up 134% year over year, driven by a 320% increase in Model 3 deliveries and slightly offset by a 21% decrease in Model S and X deliveries.

But here's where the positive news for Model S and X came in. Even though the two vehicles' deliveries were down year over year, they were up significantly on a sequential basis. Combined Model S and X deliveries during the period increased 46% compared to Q1. Such a sharp increase in deliveries was surprising after sales plummeted in Q1.

Of course, there was a good reason for lower sales in Q1: The federal credit for electric vehicles was cut in half at the end of 2018, prompting many customers to order Model S and X in the fourth quarter of last year in order to take advantage of the full credit. But some investors were likely worried that much of Tesla's first-quarter sales slump for the two vehicles was also due to cannibalization from growing Model 3 sales. While cannibalization could still be negatively impacting Model S and X deliveries, its impact may not be as bad as some suspected.

Still critical to Tesla's bottom line

A recovery in Model S and X sales is also important to Tesla's bottom line. With a price tag about twice what the Model 3 costs, Model S and X sport a higher gross profit margin than Model 3. As of Tesla's most recent quarterly shareholder letter, the Model 3's gross margin was about 20%. This compares to about 25% (and sometimes greater) for Model S and X. With a wider profit margin on higher average selling prices compared to the Model 3, the Model S and X contribute much more money per vehicle to Tesla's business than the Model 3.

Further, since Tesla still hasn't become sustainably profitable, every dollar counts. While Tesla expects Model 3's gross margin to swell to 25% eventually, it's not there yet. This means the electric-car company needs all the help it can get from Model S and X."
141,0.9937,0.109,0.839,0.052,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) gained nearly 5% after reporting record-high quarterly vehicle deliveries. Total deliveries of vehicles — comprising Model S, Model X and Model 3 — through the June quarter of 2019 was better than the expectations of most analysts.

Apparently, the stock is poised to scale higher as Tesla’s Q2 vehicles production and delivery data suggest that demand for the company’s electric cars is robust. However, many analysts are skeptical that the record deliveries may not guarantee profits for Q2.

Through the second quarter of 2019, Tesla has handed over a total of 95,200 vehicles that not only exceeds the year-ago quarter’s level but also surpasses the fourth-quarter 2018 record figure of 90,700.

Of the total Q2 deliveries, the count of Model S and Model X totaled 17,650, while the tally for Model 3 was considerably higher at 77,550. In the year-ago quarter, deliveries for Model 3 were 18,440 as compared with 22,300 combined deliveries of Model S and Model X.

Over the quarters, the company’s Model 3 sedan deliveries seems to have surged, beating the count for the more expensive and higher-margin vehicles like Model S and Model X.

Profits Unlikely

Despite the higher deliveries of premium-margin sedan cars — Model S and Model X — both in the December quarter of 2018 and the June quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2019, Tesla reported a non-significant profit figure of $139 million in fourth-quarter 2018 and a loss of $718 million in the second quarter of the same year.

Hence, the increased demand for mass-market sedan vehicle Model 3 in the second quarter of 2019 is unlikely to make any meaningful contribution to the company’s bottom line, according to The Wall Street Journal. This skepticism is also being reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s bottom line for the June quarter of this year which stands at a loss of 63 cents.

It is quite widely known that the price of Model 3 has been cut to roughly $35,000 as the company has been working through the January to June period of 2019 to expand the reach of the compact car to customers.

Is Tesla’s Secret Lab for Battery Cells a Savior?

However, media reports claim that Tesla’s effort to make Model 3 more accessible by lowering price is not sustainable considering the major cost component of the electric car — its battery.

CNBC revealed that Tesla, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been striving to manufacture battery cells in its undisclosed laboratory. This will significantly lower Tesla’s dependence on Panasonic Corporation (PCRFY - Free Report) , which has been supplying batteries to the Silicon Valley auto maker over the past several years. Once Tesla starts manufacturing batteries for its own cars, the company will be able to deliver electric cars that are cheaper yet more efficient, added CNBC.

The Last Word

The odds are against Tesla with analysts raising questions about its vehicle handover speed, per The Wall Street Journal. To reach the low end of its delivery guidance for 2019 of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, the company needs to speed up deliveries through the July to December period.

Moreover, most analysts do not expect Tesla to report profit in 2019, slashing estimates over the last 60 days for the company’s bottom line, which is currently pinned at a loss of $1.16.

With skepticism marring Tesla’s progress, investors might want to keep eyes on other major automotive companies with strong focus on the electric vehicle market. A few names in the space are General Motors (GM - Free Report) , Ford Motor Company (F - Free Report) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC - Free Report) . While General Motors and Honda Motor carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Ford Motor sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Following an absolutely brutal May in which Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock slumped 22% as Wall Street largely panned the electric vehicle (EV) and solar solutions company, shares rebounded 20.7% in June, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, amid assertions by CEO Elon Musk that the company could set a fresh quarterly record for vehicle deliveries and production.

So what

Perhaps it was happenstance that Tesla stock hit its lowest levels since late 2016 on the first trading day of last month. Nonetheless, with that low mark established, it promptly began to rebound early last month despite a rising chorus of concerns (may require subscription) over whether demand for Tesla's vehicles was great enough to meet its aggressive guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019.

It certainly helped when, on June 5, JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha cited May EV registration data to argue demand for Tesla's affordable Model 3 sedan ""continues to be solid."" Osha followed by reiterating his outperform rating on Tesla stock but simultaneously reduced his per-share price target to $347 at the time (still an enormous premium even from today's price of around $235).

Sure enough, a week later, Musk himself insisted at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting that there was no demand problem, adding that orders and sales ""for the Model S, X, and 3 [were] outpacing production"" and giving them a ""decent shot"" at setting fresh records for production and deliveries.

Now what

Indeed, Tesla shares went on to jump as much as 7.6% yesterday (then settled to close up nearer to 5%) after the company did exactly that, setting a fresh high mark with 87,048 vehicles produced and 95,200 vehicles delivered in the second quarter. The latter marked growth of 134% year over year, 51% sequentially from last quarter, and was well above Wall Street's average estimates for 91,000 deliveries.

Tesla elaborated that it entered the third quarter with an increase in order backlog, as orders generated exceeded deliveries, and that it made ""significant progress streamlining [...] global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to [its] working capital position.""

Make no mistake: That's a good thing for margins considering the vast majority of Tesla's Q2 deliveries (77,550) were the lower-priced Model 3 variety.

Still, many industry watchers continue to express skepticism for whether this demand is truly sustainable over the longer term -- though given current visibility, Tesla believes it should be able to continue growing production and deliveries at least into the third quarter.

We'll hear more to that end when Tesla releases its final second-quarter results either late this month or in early August. But given its encouraging progress in the meantime -- and relentless prodding from Tesla bears notwithstanding -- it was no surprise to see the stock bouncing higher in response."

Today's stock market

Data source: Yahoo! Finance.

As for individual stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported vehicle production and deliveries for the second quarter, and Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) announced leadership changes.

Tesla meets guidance for vehicle deliveries

Tesla reported record second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries, and shares of the electric-auto maker jumped 4.6%. The company produced 87,048 vehicles in Q2, up from 77,100 last quarter, and delivered 95,200 vehicles, compared with 63,000 in Q1.

Most of the growth came from the Model 3, which had a 17% sequential jump in production after an increase of only 3% last quarter. But deliveries of Models S and X made a comeback after disappointing results in Q1, growing 46% to 17,650. Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3 units in the quarter. The company had said to expect between 90,000 and 100,000 total vehicles delivered in Q2, so the actual number of 95,200 fell right in the middle of guidance, but above the expectations of many skeptical observers.

Tesla bears have been concerned that demand for its vehicles is waning, but the company provided some evidence to the contrary. Orders generated in the quarter exceeded deliveries, so its backlog has increased. ""We believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3,"" Tesla said in the press release.

Canopy Growth shakes up its leadership

Canopy Growth, the largest marijuana company by market capitalization, announced that co-CEO and board member Bruce Linton will be leaving both roles, effective immediately. Shares of Canopy opened lower after the announcement, but investors apparently decided the news wasn't such a bummer after all, and the stock closed up 2.5%.

Co-CEO Mark Zekulin will become the sole chief executive of Canopy Growth, but not for long. The press release said that Zekulin will assist the board in identifying a new leader ""to guide the company in its next phase of growth."" The board also appointed John Bell, the lead independent director, as the new chairman of the board.

Canopy disappointed investors with its results last quarter, reporting a huge loss of 323 million Canadian dollars and a sequential decline in recreational marijuana sales. Probably no investor was more unhappy than Constellation Brands, the U.S. beverage company that's put $4 billion into its partner in the marijuana industry and has two seats on the board. Constellation CEO Bill Newlands, one of those two Canopy directors, was unusually blunt in his company's earnings conference call, saying Constellation was ""not pleased"" with the quarter, and that assessment surely played a part in the shake-up today."
145,0.998,0.149,0.838,0.013,"Major automotive companies recently posted their sales results for the month of June. SUV and pickup truck demand still remained strong but passenger cars continued their decline.

U.S auto sales are slowing amid a decelerating economy as people don’t seem as eager to go out and spend money on a vehicle. High interest rates on top of the competition from off-lease vehicles have pushed people away from investing in new cars. Slower than expected job growth also factors into the equation with fewer than expected people having disposable income.

While car makers are experiencing a slowing market at the moment, the door is still open for a Fed rate cut that can bring eager consumers flocking to dealerships. Pickup truck sales have remained strong, providing a boost for companies who dominate the market share for those vehicles. Let’s take a further look into automotive stocks that can jump out as winners later this year.

The company was able to blow by our previous earnings estimate of $0.26 by $0.18 for an EPS surprise of 69.23%. Our year-over-year consensus estimates are projecting a 13.79% earnings spike to go along with a 2.13% revenue increase for the next quarter. Ford was also able to increase its earnings by 46.67% despite its revenue falling 3.47% from the previously reported quarter. This sales decline can be remedied by a July rate cut, which could propel the company into another solid quarter.

PACCAR

PACCAR (PCAR - Free Report) is a global technology company that designs and manufactures commercial vehicles sold worldwide under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. PACCAR is another automotive stock that has been able to see some successful returns this year, as it is currently up 24.4% on the year. The automotive company is currently listed at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is showing solid potential. Zacks Consensus Estimates are currently forecasting a 13.84% jump in earnings with a 12.60% hike in total sales for the current quarter. The company has been able to consecutively surpass our estimates the past four quarters for an average EPS surprise of 7.17%. PACCAR’s valuation also makes it an appealing stock as it is currently trading 10X its forward earnings, which is below the industry average.

Tesla

Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) has recently made headlines: the electric car company was able to deliver 95,200 cars in the second quarter. This delivery surge is a 51.1% increase from its first quarter delivery numbers. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was under scrutiny the previous quarter for only delivering 63,000 vehicles while analysts were expecting 76,000. The second quarter delivery spike was able to shatter the company’s previous best of 90,700 set in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Tesla has had a tremendous 4 weeks, with shares climbing 21.4%. Our Zacks Consensus Estimates are currently calling for a 12.78% increase in earnings for the current year. In addition, Consensus Estimates are also predicting revenue to hit $25.57 billion compared to the previous year’s $21.46 billion. Looking even further ahead, estimates are anticipating earnings to soar a whopping 620%, with total revenue going up by 22.86% for 2020. Tesla is an innovative car company that has the potential to pioneer the future landscape of the automobile industry.

146,0.9864,0.102,0.874,0.023,"Wednesday morning brought new highs for the stock market, as investors continued to believe that improved conditions for the global economy are right around the corner. The naming of Christine Lagarde to take Mario Draghi's place as head of the European Central Bank brought new optimism for Europe's struggling economy. As of 11:15 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 95 points, to 26,882. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^SPX) gained 14 points, to 2,987, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^COMP) was higher by 45 points, to 8,154.

In North America, a couple of high-profile news items had major implications for the companies involved. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) got good news on the delivery front, validating CEO Elon Musk's assertions about the electric-vehicle specialist being able to meet its goals. On the other hand, the surprise departure of Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) co-CEO Bruce Linton shocked many cannabis investors, even though the stock's response to the change in the executive suite was surprisingly muted.

Making the delivery

Shares of Tesla climbed more than 6% Wednesday morning following the release of second-quarter production and delivery information from the carmaker. The company successfully delivered 95,200 vehicles during the period, setting a new quarterly record and reassuring those who had feared that ongoing logistical challenges might cause a disappointing set of numbers.

The gain in deliveries came entirely from skyrocketing movement of the mass-market Model 3 sedan. Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s during the period, which was more than quadruple the roughly 18,450 cars it delivered in the second quarter of 2018.

Elsewhere, some Tesla watchers were troubled by the fact that upscale Model S and Model X vehicles once again saw substantial year-over-year declines. Deliveries of the two higher-end models were down more than 20%, to 17,650. However, Tesla managed to get more of these vehicles to customers than they did during the first quarter of 2019, with sequential growth coming in at 46%.

Even more encouraging for Tesla shareholders is the fact that even with higher delivery numbers, backlog for outstanding orders grew. That signals that demand for the vehicles remains high, and most of those following Tesla expect that the company should be able to meet the target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries for the full 2019 year.

Canopy makes a big move

Shares of Canopy Growth were unchanged Wednesday morning as they recovered from losses of as much as 5% earlier in the session. The move followed news that Bruce Linton would step down from Canopy's board of directors and give up his co-CEO title.

Canopy tried to position the transition as a necessary step in the cannabis company's evolution. As Linton said in the press release announcing the move: ""Creating Canopy Growth began with an abandoned chocolate factory and a vision. The board [of directors] decided today, and I agreed, my turn is over."" Yet in interviews following the announcement, Linton said that the decision to terminate his employment wasn't voluntary.

Mark Zekulin, who was co-CEO with Linton, will remain in the role during a transition phase. Yet Zekulin acknowledges his own eventual destiny, saying that, ""I personally remain committed to a successful transition over the coming year as we begin a process to identify new leadership that will drive our collective vision forward.""

Going forward, Canopy will find out just how important individual personalities are to the budding cannabis industry. Linton earned substantial respect for his achievements at Canopy, and his leadership likely opened doors where other executives wouldn't have been able to succeed. Shareholders seem convinced that the co-CEO's ouster won't hurt the company, but it's far from certain that Canopy will find a new leader who can match what Linton accomplished."
147,0.9719,0.129,0.864,0.007,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped on Wednesday morning, rising as much as 7.6%. As of 9:40 a.m., the stock was up about 5%.

The gain in the electric-car maker's shares follows Tesla's quarterly update on vehicle deliveries and production Tuesday afternoon. Prompting the Street's upbeat response to the news, deliveries for the quarter were better than expected.

So what

The automaker delivered a record 95,200 vehicles during its second quarter, up from about 63,000 units in the prior quarter and 40,800 in the year-ago quarter.

Tesla also said it ""made significant progress streamlining our global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to our working capital position.""

Higher deliveries during the quarter were primarily due to a huge jump in Model 3 production. Tesla produced 72,531 Model 3 vehicles, up from 28,578 units in the year-ago quarter.

Now what

Tesla also provided promising news on the demand for its vehicles. ""Orders generated during the quarter exceeded our deliveries,"" the company said.

For the full year, Tesla is aiming to grow total vehicle deliveries 45% to 65% year over year. A 134% year-over-year increase in second-quarter deliveries makes achieving this full-year outlook seem more likely."
148,0.9852,0.109,0.868,0.023,"Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) second-quarter vehicle production and delivery update is out -- and investors are impressed based on the stock's sharp 7% jump in after-hours trading as of 6:40 p.m. EDT Tuesday. Deliveries during the quarter surged to a record high, driven primarily by a huge increase in Model 3 deliveries.

The upbeat update on Tesla's vehicle sales follows worse-than-expected first-quarter deliveries, when the company's overseas expansion led to logistical challenges.

Second-quarter production and deliveries

Tesla delivered a record 95,200 vehicles in its second quarter. Fueled by continued growth in Model 3 production, this figure was up 134% year over year and 51% sequentially. These deliveries easily beat analysts' average forecast for deliveries of 91,000 units during the quarter. In addition, the figure was ahead of Tesla's previous quarterly record of about 90,966 vehicles.

Of these deliveries, Tesla estimates 77,550 were Model 3 and 17,650 were Model S and X vehicles.

Deliveries are Tesla's end-of-quarter estimates and final figures can vary by around 0.5%, according to Tesla. Data source: Tesla's quarterly vehicle delivery updates and shareholder letters.

Capturing where growth came from during the quarter, Model 3 deliveries soared 320% as the vehicle's production jumped. In the year-ago quarter, Tesla was still in ""production hell,"" with production running about six months behind schedule. But now Tesla was able to produce 72,531 Model 3 units in its second quarter alone, setting the stage for a huge year-over-year increase in Model 3 deliveries.

Looking beyond Model 3 deliveries, it's worth noting that even though Model S and X deliveries were down 21% year over year, they were up 46% sequentially. This suggests that demand for the pricey vehicles is improving after a pull-forward of demand during the fourth quarter of 2018 (due to the halving of the federal electric vehicle tax credit at the end of last year) negatively impacted S and X deliveries in the first quarter of 2019.

Demand remains robust

Perhaps one of the most important takeaways in Tesla's update on Tuesday was regarding the demand for Tesla's vehicles.

""Orders generated during the quarter exceeded our deliveries, thus we are entering Q3 with an increase in our order backlog,"" Tesla stated. ""We believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3.""

Tesla's better-than-expected second-quarter deliveries and management's optimistic update on demand for its vehicles bode well for the automaker's ability to meet its full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 total deliveries."

Tesla deliveries smash estimates

The many doubters of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are keeping a low profile tonight following the company's latest operational update. After markets closed, the high-profile electric-car maker released the production and delivery figures from its second quarter. For the period, the company produced 87,048 vehicles and delivered 95,200. Both results were record highs for Tesla.

They were also significantly higher than those in the same quarter of 2018. In that period, Tesla produced 53,339 cars and delivered 40,740.

Among the vehicle models, the second-quarter 2019 numbers break down like so:

Data source: Tesla.

The company added that in the second quarter, it took in more orders than it could deliver. As a result, as it entered its current third quarter, its order backlog increased. However, ""[w]e believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3,"" wrote Tesla in the press release unveiling the numbers.

The company's 95,200 total deliveries well exceeded the average analyst estimate of 91,000. According to MarketWatch.com, citing FactSet data, this is the most convincing beat in over three years.

Tesla did not provide any financial data along with the operational figures. It said this will occur when it releases Q2 results.

Understandably, Tesla is one of the most actively traded stocks this evening. It's currently up 7% over its closing market price.

Waymo self-driving cars get California permit

Today, California's Public Utilities Commission granted a permit to Alphabet 's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo unit to function as a charter-party carrier of passengers. In other words, its self-driving cars will be allowed to shuttle passengers when operating within the state. The permit is valid for three years.

That permission comes with several important caveats, though. The Alphabet unit will not be allowed to charge its passengers a fare for their rides. Also, a human operator must always be present in the driver's seat.

Those limits, though, aren't very restrictive, and they allow Waymo a lot of scope to keep developing its autonomous technology. In turn, this will help advance the broader effort to automate vehicles."
150,0.9933,0.091,0.875,0.034,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) has had a rough 2019 as it tries to expand production, with its stock price down 32.8%. Former GE (GE - Free Report) Vice Chair Beth Comstock sympathized this week with CEO Elon Musk’s financial worries saying, “Getting to scale, getting your logistics organized in these fast-growing companies is really hard.”

Most of Tesla’s stock price troubles came from abysmal Q1 earnings and production numbers. The company produced just 63,000 vehicles, with 10,600 still in transit at the end of the quarter. This was a 31% decrease in production and a 5.6x increase in cars in transit from the previous quarter. All of this resulted in a loss of $702 million in Q1.

In February, Consumer Reports announced that it would remove its “recommended” rating from the Tesla Model 3. Thereby leaving no Tesla vehicles on its recommended list. Consumer Reports dropped the Model 3 because of a long list of customer-cited quality concerns, which included software glitches, ill-fitting body panels, and defective glass.

Last week, Tesla’s VP of Production, Peter Hochholdinger, left the company. This came as a shock and shook investor confidence since Tesla is currently in the midst of rapid production capacity growth. Hochholdinger’s departure is the latest in a series of executive exodus. Tesla VP of interior & exterior engineering Steve MacManus left last week as well. There have now been 11 high-level departures so far in 2019.

Meanwhile, some, like Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, have suggested that Tesla is in a working capital bind. Estimates show that Tesla’s large number of vehicles in transit at the end of Q1 could have put strain on net working capital of $800 million.

Musk himself was also famously in trouble with the SEC after he tweeted about possibly taking the company private, which impacted share prices. The SEC and Musk settled out of court, with Musk agreeing to a $20 million fine and to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board.

Musk’s Day Dreams?

After Q1’s disappointing performance, Musk projected 90,000-100,000 cars delivered in Q2. This would mark a 43-59% increase in production in just one quarter. Tesla did deliver 90,700 vehicles in Q4 2018. If production lines can get back to late last year’s levels, it is feasible to meet this goal. If Tesla does meet its delivery goal, shares are likely to jump significantly.

However, the U.S. tax credits provided to customers who buy electric cars are set to expire, which could significantly decrease consumer incentive to buy these cars. The tax credit was cut from $7,500 to $3,750 on January 1 and was cut in half again on July 1st to $1,875. The tax credit will expire completely for 2020.

During this year, Tesla is set to launch production at its first Chinese factory to keep up with the largest electric vehicle market on the planet. Tesla also claims to be deciding on a location for its first European factory later this year and will start to sell in India next year.

Tesla also has plans to announce an electric consumer pickup later this summer. This car could sell very well and break into the 2+ million vehicle per year pickup truck market. But it could overcomplicate production as the EV marker tries to ramp up its vital Model 3 output.

Bottom Line

Tesla is an extremely innovative and much talked about company. But it is clearly not without faults. The product quality issues, corporate instability, and subpar production numbers are enough to make many investors nervous.

On top of this, Tesla stock has underperformed the market by 49.7% in 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate shows Tesla with a projected -1.16 EPS for 2019, which is a significant loss for a 16-year-old company. Tesla currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but this is a recent upgrade from its #4 (Sell) earlier this month.

Jim Chanos, founder of the world’s largest short-selling hedge fund and a large bear on Tesla, believes that Tesla will never reach its goals. He has stated that investors tend to treat TSLA like a tech company, when in reality it has to learn the lessons that Detroit automakers learned 100 years ago. The biggest reason to bet against Tesla, Chanos argues, is that the company is not actually a leader in electric and autonomous cars.

With other automakers moving into the electric vehicle segment, Tesla will be hard pressed to stay on top. Competitor Volkswagen (VWAGY - Free Report) has 8 fully electric cars coming before 2022 in its “I.D” line while Ford (F - Free Report) has almost a dozen full-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in development and on the market. Tesla will also have to compete with the myriad of electric vehicle startups like Lucid Motors, Rimac, Rivian, and SF Motors, that have sprung up in recent years.

In a well-cited study conducted back in 2016, consulting firm Bain & Company completed a performance analysis of all the S&P 500 companies and found that founder-led businesses outperformed all others by more than 3-to-1 between 1990 and 2014.

But what is it that makes founder-led companies so successful?

Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos publishes his annual letter to shareholders every year and in 2016, he spoke about the reasons why he believes that founder-led businesses are usually better businesses. This small excerpt from that letter is one of the most poignant statements ever made about business and investing:

One area where I think we are especially distinctive is failure. I believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment. Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there. Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time.

The business world tends to punish failure, particularly when it comes to big publicly traded companies. In reality, failure is an essential part of innovation, and companies with a passionate founder tend to be far less averse to getting things wrong because they have plenty of experience with it.

Simply put, founder-led businesses tend to perform better because their leaders are not just professional CEOs tasked with maximizing shareholder return, but passionate entrepreneurs who know that taking a calculated risk is necessary for the long-term success of their company.

1. Tesla Motors

Elon Musk is one of the world's most noted entrepreneurs and has said of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) that ""failure is an option here. If you're not failing, you're not innovating enough.""

When you're disrupting an industry as old and embedded as the auto industry, it's always going to be a tough ride. Tesla is a company that's certainly no stranger to failure. Short-term goals, particularly in terms of the production and delivery of the all-important Model 3, have been missed more often than not, but in the business of changing the way the world fundamentally works, the significance of quarterly goals should not be of primary concern for investors.

Musk now believes the future of Tesla lies in a fleet of robotaxis, allowing Tesla customers to generate income from their vehicles when they don't need them. If that sounds pretty far-fetched to you, you're not alone, but Musk's track record on this kind of stuff is pretty remarkable, if somewhat a bit behind schedule.

The appointment of new Chairman Robyn Denholm late last year will hopefully sort out some of the governance issues at Tesla and allow Musk to do what he's best at -- harnessing that incredible imagination to build the world of the future.

2. Planet Fitness

Most people wouldn't have believed that there was any real way to differentiate yourself in the world of gyms. What the founders of Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) -- Michael and Marc Grondahl -- realized back in 1992, however, was that most gym users only use a small subsection of the available equipment. In addition, they figured that many casual or first-time gym-goers can find the experience of going to the gym quite intimidating.

With a radical reimagining of the gym experience, they risked massive failure. What they got instead was an entirely new concept that focused on just the simplest equipment and creating the ""Judgement Free Zone,"" where people could feel comfortable working out.

What they did was to carve out a blue ocean opportunity for themselves -- one with a lot fewer competitors. Suddenly, even though what they're selling is a gym membership, it's actually a totally different thing, appealing to a totally different type of consumer.

Planet Fitness now has more than 13.6 million members and 1,806 locations across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Mexico. The Grondahl brothers are still running the company with their partner, Chris Rondeau, acting as CEO.

3. Netflix

From inception, virtually all the big business decisions made by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and CEO Reed Hastings carried significant risk: becoming the first online DVD rental store in the world, dropping the option to pay for single rentals and charging a flat monthly subscription fee instead, introducing a streaming service in 2007 that eventually became the company's primary business.

Possibly the biggest risk taken by the company, however, was to start getting involved in the creation of its own original content. Beginning with House of Cards in 2013, Netflix has grown to become one of the biggest producers of TV shows and movies, with $12 billion spent on content in 2018 alone.

This strategy is paying off though, with original programming dominating the company's most-watched lists, despite making up only 11% of Netflix's entire U.S. catalog at the end of last year. Netflix has also adopted a ruthless approach to failure with its original content, with the notoriously data-driven company basing the decisions to cancel shows on algorithms.

But in talking about Netflix and the importance of embracing failure, let's not forget what might have been one of the most fortuitous failures in business history of the 21st century: having Blockbuster reject an offer buy the company for $50 million in 2000."

While investors will want to look into how well all of Tesla's vehicle models are selling, the Model 3 remains the primary focus for investors. Highlighting the Model 3's growing importance to Tesla's business, the vehicle accounted for nearly 70% of the automaker's trailing-12-month deliveries -- and that figure is expected to rise.

When Tesla reports production and deliveries next week, can the Model 3 live up to investors' high expectations?

Model 3 deliveries

In the first quarter of 2019, Tesla delivered about 51,000 Model 3s. While this was up 522% year over year, it was down 20% sequentially. Of course, Tesla was careful to point out that this was primarily due to a larger number of vehicles in transit to customers because of the company's international expansion during the quarter. In addition, it has clarified on several occasions that demand for Model 3 is not a problem. Indeed, earlier this week, CEO Elon Musk reportedly told employees in an email that there are enough vehicle orders in the current quarter to set a new record for total deliveries, implying that demand for Model 3 remains robust.

With demand reportedly faring well, the big question is whether Model 3 production -- and Tesla's ability to deliver finished vehicles to customers -- was sufficient enough for the electric-car company to report record Model 3 deliveries.

To set a new record for Model 3 deliveries in Q2, Tesla will need to deliver more than 63,359 units (the number of Model 3 units delivered in the fourth quarter of 2018). This would translate to 24% sequential growth and a staggering 243% increase over Model 3 deliveries in the year-ago quarter.

Looking ahead

Perhaps even more telling than second-quarter Model 3 deliveries will be any statements from management in next week's update about expectations for Model 3 production and deliveries throughout the rest of the year.

In order for Tesla to hit its full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 total vehicle deliveries in 2019, Model 3 deliveries are likely going to need to be higher in the second half of 2019 than they were in the first half. To gauge whether Tesla can pull off its ambitious outlook, look for updates on the Model 3 production rate and the most recent demand trends."
153,0.9965,0.16,0.828,0.012,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) has delivered 49,000 vehicles in North America so far in second-quarter 2019, per Reuters. According to Electrek, this is below the electric vehicle (EV) giant’s expectation and is likely to affect its goal of creating a record for new vehicle delivery in the quarter.
In first-quarter 2019, Tesla’s vehicle production and delivery numbers witnessed sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively. In the same quarter, it managed to produce roughly 77,100 vehicles — consisting of 62,950 Model 3, and 14,150 Model S and X. Out of the total delivered figure of 63,000 units, the company’s Model 3 accounted for 50,900 while Model S and X were 12,100. This raised concerns about its ability to make profits and meet its delivery targets while encountering issues pertaining to cash flow and manufacturing.
However, Tesla’s chief executive officer, Elon Musk, stated that the company has enough orders to set a record for vehicle deliveries in the second quarter. In a leaked email, he has added that there is no scarcity of orders but right vehicles are not all in right locations yet.

154,0.9992,0.162,0.811,0.027,"As heated as the stock market has been over the past decade, value investors might not feel like there's a good deal to be had out there. Moreover, the concept of what true value investing means has evolved over the years. So while you may not be able to find dollar bills selling for pennies, there are still high-quality business to be found, trading for a nice discount to fair value.

To help you get started finding the next value stock for your portfolio, we asked three of our most-seasoned contributors to put forth their ideas for value today, and they came back with Axos Financial (NASDAQ:AX), Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS), and -- you may want to sit down for this one -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Axos and Vipshop? Yep, those look quite cheap based on some pretty easy-to-identify metrics. But Tesla? We're pretty sure Steve Symington is rational, at least based on his track record. Don't worry -- we had someone check in on him, and he's fine, despite the, ahem, interesting suggestion that Tesla's a value stock. Moreover, he makes a compelling case, and with skin in the game after recently buying shares, he does, at least as far as we know, believe his own thesis.

Without further ado, keep reading to learn about two value stocks based on clear -- and compelling -- metrics, and Steve's surprisingly solid case that Tesla could be the biggest value out there if you squint your eyes just right.

The best value in banking

Jason Hall (Axos Financial): When it comes to valuing banks, the two most common -- and I think the two most useful -- metrics are price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to- book-value (P/B) ratios. In short, these two metrics identify both how the market values a bank's earnings and the assets it makes those earnings from. My argument is that Axos Financial is cheap by both of those measures.

As this table shows, Axos has rarely been this inexpensive, by either measure, in recent years:

Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying it was necessarily fairly valued at some of the peak valuations it has traded for in the past, but trading for 1.5 times book value and 11 times earnings per share is simply cheap for such a high-quality business that's as profitable as it is. For context, it now trades for a similar book value to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and a discount to the mega-bank's earnings multiple:

AX PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts.

Here's the rub: Axos has a history of delivering far better profitability and returns than even JPMorgan, which is rightfully considered one of the best-run banks in the world:

Here's the closing point: Axos is also much smaller and, under CEO Greg Garrabrants, has an incredible track record of both growth and de-risking, and I expect Axos to continue becoming more diverse and profitable for years to come.

Axos is already one of the biggest online-only banks, and its prospects to grow from a small internet bank to a national financial services powerhouse make it worth owning. The fact that it's cheaper than some of the best banks in America right now makes it worth buying today.

An oft-overlooked Chinese e-commerce company

Leo Sun (Vipshop): Vipshop is often overshadowed by Alibaba and JD.com in China's crowded e-commerce market, but the smaller company is thriving in the shadow of its bigger peers.

Vipshop retained its first mover's advantage in the flash sale market, and it attracted big investments from JD and Tencent. Those investments and partnerships tethered Vipshop's flash sale platform to JD Mall and Tencent's WeChat, the top mobile messaging app in China.

As a result, Vipshop's growth in active customers accelerated over the past year, rising 14% annually to 29.7 million last quarter and marking its third straight quarter of double-digit growth. Its total orders rose 29% to 116.5 million, allaying concerns about slower consumer spending.

Vipshop's gross and operating margins both expanded annually during the quarter, indicating that its loss-leading model (which uses flash sales to spur purchases of full-priced products) is sustainable. Its total revenue rose 7% annually as its adjusted net income grew 12% (in RMB terms), and analysts anticipate 3% sales growth and 17% earnings growth (in USD terms) for the full year. That's a high growth rate for a stock that trades at just nine times forward earnings.

Vipshop controlled only 1.8% of China's e-commerce market last year, according to eMarketer. However, its steady growth, strong support from JD and Tencent, and low valuation make it a lucrative value play on China's booming e-commerce market.

An incredible value (depending on who you ask)

Steve Symington (Tesla): I chuckled earlier this week when Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas insisted his firm continues ""to believe Tesla is fundamentally overvalued, but potentially strategically undervalued.""

That dichotomy perfectly explains how the market feels about the electric vehicle (EV) and solar solutions leader. With Tesla shares trading at roughly $220 per share as of this writing -- or more than 40% below their 52-week high -- various analysts have assigned price ""targets"" ranging from $4,000 all the way down to $0.

On one hand, there's the omnipresent threat of potentially underwhelming demand for Tesla's vehicles, and for this currently unprofitable business to run low on cash -- something bearish traders seized on last month after CEO Elon Musk reportedly told employees the company would be implementing a ""hardcore"" cost-cutting program -- as it implements ambitious plans for ramping EV production and funding geographic expansion.

On the other hand, Musk went on record at Tesla's annual investor meeting last week to insist there's no demand problem, with sales exceeding production. He also teased the end-of-summer unveiling of the company's affordable (starting at under $50,000) new electric pickup truck, and (earlier last month) outlined compelling plans to build a massive robotaxi fleet that -- to hear Musk tell it -- could be the catalyst to multiply the company's value to $500 billion (from closer to $40 billion today).

I'll take that last prediction with a grain of salt given Musk's history of overly ambitious goals. But I think there is enough potential positive catalysts for patient, long-term investors to lean on the ""potentially strategically undervalued"" side of the fence, which is why I added a small position in Tesla to my personal portfolio last week."
155,0.9826,0.08,0.892,0.028,"There's been a lot of drama leading up to Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) second-quarter vehicle deliveries update. Some analysts have expressed concerns about demand for the company's electric cars even as Tesla asserts there's plenty of interest in its vehicles. In addition, CEO Elon Musk sent out an email about halfway through the quarter, urging employees to rally and push hard to achieve record deliveries.

Despite this recent commentary on Tesla's vehicle delivery trends, it's still not clear how many electric cars the company can deliver this quarter. Nevertheless here's an effort to peg a forecast on the key metric as the quarter comes to an end.

Expect huge growth

Though the exact number of deliveries Tesla will make during Q2 is difficult to estimate, one thing is clear: Deliveries will probably be up significantly both sequentially and compared to the year-ago quarter. That's because (a) Tesla deliveries pulled back sharply in Q1 and (b) Model 3 production has ramped up since the second quarter of 2018.

Going into its second quarter, Tesla management guided for second-quarter deliveries between 90,000 and 100,000 units, up significantly from the 63,000 vehicles Tesla delivered in its first quarter of 2019 but down from the record 91,000 vehicles Tesla delivered in its fourth quarter of 2018. Highlighting the uncanny growth in Tesla's business over the past year, deliveries at the low end of management's guidance would still represent 121% year-over-year growth.

There's good reason to expect Tesla to at least post deliveries around the low end of its guidance range. Musk said in a May 22 email to employees that current delivery trends indicated the company had ""a good chance of exceeding"" the record deliveries it posted in its fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, Musk reiterated to investors at the company's June 11 shareholder meeting that Tesla had ""a good shot"" at achieving record deliveries during the quarter. ""If not, it's going to be very close,"" he added.

Tesla's second-quarter deliveries, therefore, will probably come in somewhere between 89,500 and 92,000 units. Whether they fall in this range or even slightly below it, Tesla's year-over-year growth is undeniably astounding for a company in one of the most capital-intensive industries in the world.

Looking beyond Q2

While the figures Tesla reports for its second quarter could potentially move the stock up or down, depending on where they fall, investors should look beyond reported deliveries when the update on production and deliveries is released.

The bigger question will be whether Tesla maintains its outlook for full-year deliveries to be between 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles. Reiterating this guidance would suggest management is confident in both production and demand for the rest of the year. And given how important higher sales are for Tesla to achieve profitability, a moderated full-year outlook could spook investors.

Tesla usually posts its production and delivery metrics within a few days of each quarter's end. In other words, investors can expect the update sometime between July 1 and July 3."
156,0.3746,0.092,0.815,0.093,"Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...

Just one day after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) got rocked by a pair of analysts reiterating their sell ratings -- sending the stock down 3% -- shares of the world's most famous electric-car maker are mostly sidelined today on apparently conflicting reports from two more analysts.

Let's find out why.

What happened yesterday

Uniformly negative notes out of RBC Capital and Goldman Sachs torpedoed the stock's recent rally. From the first trading day of June through Wednesday, Tesla -- which had been under pressure on worries of flagging demand for its Model 3 sedan -- surged 26% higher as investors began taking to heart CEO Elon Musk's prediction that Q2 2019 could see Tesla report ""the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!""

But contradicting this optimistic tone, on Thursday RBC warned that in fact, ""2Q19 total deliveries may come in toward the low-end of guidance."" Furthermore, as relayed by StreetInsider.com (subscription required), in reaching for even the lower end of its guidance, ""TSLA is sacrificing profitability to focus on unit growth.""

Meanwhile, fellow investment banker Goldman Sachs attacked Tesla from an entirely different direction: Conceding before the fact that ""2Q19 should be fine,"" Goldman shifted its fire to the second half of this fiscal year, warning that ""2H19 (and beyond) volume estimates look high considering there are fewer levers to pull to stoke demand going forward.""

Investors predictably panicked, and Tesla stock fell 3%.

What's happening today

And yet, bad as these two reports make things sound, other analysts are a bit more optimistic on the Tesla front -- with one even finding silver linings around the cloudier forecasts.

Today, R.W. Baird reiterated its outperform rating on Tesla stock, and raised its price target a bit (from $340 to $355). Its reason: ""[W]e think expectations have overshot to the negative and we believe there are several catalysts upcoming which could drive shares higher (beginning with the upcoming delivery release)."" Moreover, in an apparent reference to the previous day's notes coming out of RBC (criticizing Tesla's profits) and Goldman (downplaying Q2 deliveries), Baird observed: ""[W]e have noticed bear arguments have pre-emptively shifted from demand to profitability.""

The apparent implication: As Tesla knocks down the negative arguments against it, one by one, bears are having to cast about in search of new things to complain about the company. Taking the opposite view, therefore, RBC suggests that ""[a] solid Q2 delivery announcement could set up a positive cash flow quarter and set the stage for share appreciation in 2H:19.""

A second analyst chimes in

Indeed, even the ""bad"" news we're seeing today is starting to look pretty good for Tesla. Simultaneous with Baird's price target hike, peer analyst Jefferies lowered its price target on Tesla. And yet, going from $400 down to $300, Jefferies ended up with a price target not too far off from what Baird set.

Nor was Jefferies' note on lowering its price target even terribly negative in tone. Rather, citing findings from a recent visit to Tesla's Fremont factory, the analyst expressed confidence that ""industrial efficiency [is] improving"" (addressing the profitability complaint) and even worries about Model 3 demand seem ""excessive.""

While Jefferies does cut its estimates for the company, therefore, hypothesizing that ""[f]inancial performance should remain volatile in coming quarters,"" longer-term, the analyst says it sees ""value in Tesla's technology lead (powertrain and AV development) and focus on increasingly affordable price points.""

The upshot for investors

So what are investors to make of all these conflicting opinions on Tesla? Here's my take:

Everyone's hedging their positions on Musk's innovative electric car company. Analysts -- even the bears -- seem wary of predicting that Tesla will miss on its delivery numbers at a time when the CEO himself is predicting ""the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!"" That's a bold prediction to make, and it seems unlikely Musk would clamber out on a limb and make it when he knows the company will have to confirm or deny his prediction in just a couple weeks.

(Last year, Tesla reported its Q2 deliveries on July 2 so, logically, we should see the latest report also arrive in the first week of next month.)

With that catalyst on the horizon, Tesla bears are shifting their warnings to the quarters that will come after Q2, downplaying the significance of a ""delivery beat"" in July, and harping on the company's profits numbers.

While that may seem like a disingenuous argument, however, it's not entirely unfair. After all, even if Tesla's operating and net profits have shown strength lately, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence show that its gross margin has been steadily declining for years as the company shifts to emphasize the sale of cheaper Model 3 cars instead of pricier Model S and X units.

The simple truth of the matter is that, whether you love Musk or hate him, and whether Tesla ""beats"" or ""misses"" on deliveries, the real sine qua non for Tesla stock becoming a winning investment is its ability to earn consistent profits. The company failed to meet that standard in Q1. Tesla fans need to hope it does a better job in Q2."
157,0.9403,0.09,0.841,0.068,"The debate about demand for Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles took another interesting turn this week as Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino slashed his price target for the electric-car company's stock, citing concerns about Tesla's ability to meet delivery estimates in the second half of 2019. This news comes not long after Tesla CEO Elon Musk reassured investors that the company does not face a demand problem.

The back-and-forth between Tesla and analysts about the demand for the company's vehicles highlights the uncertainty surrounding the automaker's ability to keep growing sales.

Tesla stock: headed to $158?

""We believe a downward path for shares will resume as it becomes more clear that sustainable demand for the company's current products are below expectations,"" said Tamberrino in a note to investors on Thursday morning. The analyst also cut his 12-month price target for the stock, lowering it from $200 to $158.

In the near term, however, Tamberrino believes Tesla's second-quarter deliveries will be ""fine."" Indeed, the analyst projects Tesla will exceed the low end of its guidance range for second-quarter deliveries of between 90,000 to 100,000 units. It's the second half of the year that has the analyst betting the company may not live up to estimates. Worse-than-expected demand beyond Q2, Tamberrino argues, will lead to ""a downward path for shares.""

Following this report on Thursday, Tesla shares fell about 3%. But even after this decline, Tamberrino's $158 price target represents about 28% further downside for the stock.

What should investors believe?

As Tamberrino doubles down on his bearish outlook for Tesla stock, Musk has been as adamant as ever about the company's optimistic demand story.

""I want to be clear: There is not a demand problem,"" Musk told investors during Tesla's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week. The CEO even backed up this statement with some hard data, noting that second-quarter sales ""have far exceeded production."" In addition, a slide during the presentation declared that quarter-to-date ""orders for Model S, X, and 3 are outpacing production.""

While Musk's reassurance is comforting, it's understandable why some concerns about demand for the company's vehicle remain. In order for Tesla to hit the low end of its full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries in 2019, the automaker will likely need to deliver more than 200,000 vehicles in the second half of the year. Though current order trends and the fact that the Model 3's international expansion has only recently ramped up do suggest this is possible, forecasting such significant growth does involve some speculation.

Investors will hopefully get more insight into Tesla's demand trends when the company reports its second-quarter deliveries sometime during the first few days of July. In its updates, Tesla sometimes provides helpful commentary on demand for its vehicles."

159,0.9958,0.196,0.726,0.077,"The stock market enjoyed modest gains on Monday as investors waited patiently to see if the Federal Reserve would come through with an interest rate cut when it meets later this week. Amid some signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and no hint of inflationary pressure, market participants have watched as bonds signaled a high likelihood of lower rates within the next month. That's generally been beneficial for stocks, but some companies also had good news that lifted their share prices even higher. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), C&J Energy Services (NYSE:CJ), and CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well.

No more tweeting for Musk?

Shares of Tesla jumped nearly 5% after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he would delete a key social media account that has landed him in hot water in the past. Investors in the electric vehicle specialist remember all too well what the fallout was after Musk claimed that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, only to have no deal ensue. Fundamentally, Tesla has seen impressive growth, but investors haven't been entirely satisfied with its performance. Today's gains are helping the stock make up some lost ground from earlier in the year, but it'll take a lot more than deleting a social media account to make shareholders confident in Tesla's long-term prospects.

C&J gets some energy

C&J Energy Services saw its stock soar 20% after the Houston-based energy company got a buyout bid from an industry peer. Keane Group (NYSE:NEX) has offered about $746 million to buy C&J, with investors to receive 1.6149 shares of Keane for every C&J share they own. The deal could be beneficial for both companies, because industry conditions have been tough enough that competition among energy services players has been fierce. A merger won't solve the problem of relatively weak demand for drilling rigs and other oil-field services, but it will mean a bit less pressure when bidding on prospective contracts.

CrowdStrike keeps heading higher

Finally, shares of CrowdStrike Holdings picked up 9%. The newly public company, which specializes in helping clients guard against digital attack, soared in its IPO last Wednesday, and CrowdStrike has carried positive momentum ever since. The cybersecurity industry has a lot of upward momentum right now, as threats have only increased as more companies have moved their digital operations into the cloud. With many successful initial public offerings having led to continued rises in their share prices, investors are betting that CrowdStrike can keep climbing indefinitely."

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped on Monday, rising 5.5% as of 2:50 p.m. EDT.

The stock's gain comes as one analyst pegs traders' covering of short positions on Tesla stock as a potential reason for the gain. In addition, a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk stating that he deleted his Twitter account may have encouraged some investors.

So what

Tesla stock's sharp rise on Monday may be related to ""the start of short covering over the next few weeks,"" said Baird analyst Ben Kallo, according to Benzinga. When a large number of traders with short positions cover their trades by purchasing shares, it sometimes causes a stock to rise in the near term, creating a ""short squeeze.""

Kallo has a $340 12-month price target on Tesla shares.

In addition, over the weekend Musk tweeted, ""Just deleted my Twitter account."" Given the troubles Musk's active and outspoken usage of Twitter has led to in the past, many shareholders would likely view the CEO's absence on the social media platform as a net positive.

Notably, Musk's Twitter account doesn't appear to be deleted as of Monday afternoon. But the CEO hasn't tweeted since.

Now what

While these two events may be reasons for Tesla stock's rise on Monday, investors should remain focused on the electric-car maker's fundamentals. The company needs to ramp up production while keeping costs in check in order to meet its full-year vehicle deliveries guidance and achieve profitability."
161,0.9801,0.117,0.822,0.06,"When shares of First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) plunged near the end of trading Wednesday last week, it threw investors for a loop. The U.S. trade representative announced that bifacial solar panels will be exempt from solar tariffs, which are currently 25% of the cost of imported solar panels. The move may make tariffs effectively obsolete for much of the industry.

Late last week, shares rebounded as the market realized fewer tariffs would also expand the market for solar energy. Here's a look at what we learned last week and how it affects different parts of the industry.

Solar exemptions and where we stand now

Until Wednesday, SunPower was the only company that had been given an exemption from solar tariffs. It makes a back-contact solar cell that's significantly different from commodity solar cell construction, which is why it was granted the exemption. It also didn't hurt that it bought the second-largest solar manufacturing facility in the country.

An exemption on tariffs for bifacial solar panels is based on similar logic. Bifacial technology allows a solar cell to collect power from the front and back of a panel. The second side can increase the energy production of a panel by between 11% to 27%, depending on the mounting and tracking system being used.

Not all solar manufacturers are building bifacial solar panels, but they have the ability to do so, with some minor changes. An exemption from tariffs in the U.S. could be an incentive to increase production.

The losers of these exemptions

As more solar companies become exempt from tariffs, it reduces the premium local manufacturers can charge for solar panels. First Solar clearly has the most to lose because it's the largest solar manufacturer in the U.S., and its thin-film solar panels were never included in solar tariffs.

SunPower will also see pressure on its P-Series production in Oregon. If commodity solar prices fall, it may also see pricing pressure on its high-efficiency solar panels that got an exemption from tariffs.

Tesla's Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, N.Y., may not be a great investment, either. It was already behind schedule, but now there's little economic incentive to produce solar panels in the U.S.

Someone always benefits

More exemptions and lower solar panel prices will definitely help developers and utilities. Bifacial solar panels are primarily designed for ground-mounted solar farms, so developers and project owners like NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), TerraForm Power (NASDAQ:TERP), and Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) could all see lower development costs for solar projects.

Its stock dropped yesterday, but SolarEdge could be another one of those beneficiaries if installation volumes grow. It provides inverters and power optimizers to solar installers, so it should actually see tariff exemptions as a bullish sign.

Good for solar energy overall

The solar industry overall should see its pie grow as tariffs are exempted. But manufacturers like SunPower and First Solar who have spent the past two years finding ways around tariffs or investing on the basis of being exempt may not see the benefit they once expected.

I think the big benefit from falling tariffs will ultimately be developers of renewable energy projects, who are buying the most cost-effective product in the market. They'll start to take bifacial solar panels very seriously, potentially pushing the technology into more U.S. developments."
162,0.9961,0.099,0.848,0.053,"To hear Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tell it, by next year Tesla will have overcome its recent financial challenges, will be operating a fleet of robotic taxis, and will offer cars that can drive themselves. Moreover, anyone with any other brand of car will be frustrated that he or she now owns the technological equivalent of a horse and buggy or a flip phone.

Did he actually say all that? Yep, although he partially walked back the robotic-taxi comment later.

Is it a complete fantasy? Maybe not entirely, but it's probably less likely than predicting that Tesla will wind up pretty much where it is today. But let's take a dive into Tesla's current situation to see if any of these things might come to pass by mid-2020.

The mass-market conundrum

In the beginning, Tesla was a luxury automaker, with one product: the high-end luxury Tesla Roadster sportscar with its $90,000 price tag. Since then, the company has tried to broaden its appeal by ramping up production of less expensive cars, including the Model 3 sedan (starting price: $35,000), the upcoming Model Y crossover SUV (starting price: $47,000), and a possibly soon-to-be-unveiled electric pickup truck that will purportedly rival the Ford (NYSE:F) F-150 (starting price: ""less than $50,000"").

The problem is that more expensive cars have higher margins. When you start selling less expensive vehicles -- and building giant Gigafactories and ramping up production to do so -- the amount of money you make per car takes a hit. Furthermore, when you're investing in technological innovations at the same time to ensure your cutting-edge vehicles stay on the cutting edge, it further eats into your available resources, even as it expands your potential customer base.

The good news for Tesla is that some of those investments seem to be paying off. The company appears to be able to manufacture batteries for as much as 20% less than the competition, for one thing, and it's managed to notch a couple of profitable and free cash flow-positive quarters in Q3 and Q4 2018. If it can keep this up, Tesla might actually be in a stable financial and operational position next year.

But there's one big problem.

Cars on demand

Tesla posted back-to-back profitable quarters in Q3 and Q4 2018, but it sure didn't in Q1 2019. Worse, a lower-than-expected number of quarterly deliveries -- especially for the high-margin models X and S -- fueled speculation that demand for Teslas might be drying up. That problem may have been exacerbated by a federal tax credit decrease for purchasing a Tesla that kicked in Jan. 1. The tax credit will drop again, from $3,750 to just $1,875, on the first of July. It's also possible that potential Model X buyers are holding out for the less expensive Model Y, which is set to roll out in late 2020.

Lower demand would be a big problem for the carmaker, which doesn't invest in traditional advertising such as TV commercials. It also shuttered most of its Tesla stores, relying instead on word of mouth and news coverage to spread the word about its cars.

Luckily for Tesla, it gets a lot of news coverage. But if demand is already drying up for its existing models, and with the Model Y and electric pickup truck far from production, Tesla could find itself back in a precarious financial spot, with not enough revenue coming in to fund its new projects.

For his part, Musk disputes that sales are declining. He says that both sales and orders for all three of Tesla's current models are outpacing production. But a leaked May email to employees warned that Tesla had only 10 months to become profitable and announced a ""hardcore"" cost-cutting program. Those aren't usually hallmarks of a financially healthy company.

Pie in the sky

We've all learned by now to take Musk's statements with a grain of salt. After all, I could spend pages and pages writing about the promises Musk has made that haven't come to fruition.

His comments that autonomous driving would be ready by the end of 2019 seem particularly laughable, considering Consumer Reports just panned Tesla's Autopilot lane-changing feature as ""far behind a human driver's skills."" However, Musk recently scoffed at LIDAR technology -- essentially, a radar system that uses laser beams instead of radio waves -- which just about everyone in the autonomous-vehicle space uses except Tesla. Musk relies instead on vehicle-mounted cameras and radar systems. In other words, even if some of the regulatory hurdles to introducing this technology were worked out, it's not clear that existing Tesla vehicles would make the cut.

For now, nobody, not even Alphabet 's Waymo, seems anywhere close to rolling out a mass-market autonomous vehicle within the next year, LIDAR or no LIDAR. But the incident illustrates how Tesla may be trying to do too much all on its own. Other, larger companies that have more resources are teaming up with partners to develop electric-vehicle and automated-driving technology, including Waymo's partnerships with Fiat Chrysler and Tata Motors ' Jaguar, or Ford's with Volkswagen, or Hyundai 's with start-up Aurora.

Tesla's insistence on trying to beat the big guns may not work out so well.

We were here first

One thing that's unclear is whether people interested in buying a Tesla are more interested in buying an electric vehicle, or just buying a Tesla. Tesla's brand has been rapidly increasing in value, according to market researcher Kantar Millward Brown, to the point that it's now the eighth most valuable automotive brand. But as its competitors get ready to roll out electric vehicles of their own, potentially at similar or lower price points, will it have an impact on Tesla's sales?

We'll find out sooner rather than later. Rival automaker Ford is planning to launch its own battery-electric crossover SUV based on the Mustang in 2020, and it's promising 300 miles of range. Kia is also expected to begin selling an all-electric version of the Soul that year. And unlike Tesla, Ford and Kia have pretty good track records when it comes to launching vehicles on time.

Where that leaves Tesla

So given all of this, where is Tesla likely to be in a year?

Well, barring a miracle, a completely self-driving fleet isn't going to happen. And considering Tesla hasn't managed to post more than two profitable quarters in succession, it's unlikely the company will have made much, if any, progress on putting its financial house in order. It would take sustained profitability to make that happen.

A lot depends on whether the slump in Tesla sales is a blip or a trend. And with the slew of other options coming available in 2020, that's going to depend on whether consumers are really determined to get a Tesla in 2019 or whether they're willing to wait and explore other options. I'm not so sure they won't wait, which would leave Tesla in a similar position to today: unprofitable and burning cash, but with hot prospects "" just around the corner.""

Still, as with most things Tesla, I wouldn't bet against the stock based on that theory."

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in TSLA.

A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of $1.14 a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of $1.32.

Also, for the current quarter, Tesla has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 70 cents a share from a loss of 64 cents over the past 30 days.

The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 9.8% in the past month.

Today's stock market

Data source: Yahoo! Finance.

As for individual stocks, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) plunged after reporting earnings, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slipped in the wake of its investor day.

Competition is pressuring Dave & Buster's

Dave & Buster's fiscal first-quarter earnings report was a bust with investors, with the company announcing mixed results and lowering guidance for the year, and shares plummeted 22.4%. Revenue increased 9.5% to $363.6 million and earnings per share grew 8.7% to $1.13. Analysts were expecting the company to earn $1.12 per share on revenue of $371 million.

Comparable-store sales, which had been improving in recent quarters, took a turn for the worse, falling 0.3%. The company blamed the decline on the timing of Easter and spring break, which impacted results more than it had expected, but also conceded that competition and cannibalization of existing store business by new locations were factors.

Looking forward, Dave and Buster's lowered guidance for comparable-store sales from flat to up 1.5% to a range of down 1.5% to up 0.5%. The company also lowered its net income forecast by about 3% at the midpoint.

A 3.3% decline in food and beverage comparable sales and comments in the conference call about competitive headwinds that will increase over the rest of the year contributed to investor concerns today.

Elon Musk says demand is still strong

Tesla held its annual shareholder meeting yesterday, with CEO Elon Musk expressing continued optimism about demand for its vehicles, but investors remain concerned, and the stock fell 3.6%.

In Musk's presentation, he doubled down on the issue of demand, saying, ""We get this question a lot and I want to be clear. There is not a demand problem. Absolutely not."" He said that quarter-to-date orders for Models S, X, and 3 are outpacing production, with 90% coming from non-reservation holders -- in other words, new customers. The CEO also said that Tesla had a ""decent shot at a record quarter on every level,"" apparently referring to production volumes.

Musk also dropped some tidbits of interest to investors. The purchase of Maxwell Technologies was to acquire technology that Tesla believes will reduce the cost of batteries and the capital required to scale up battery production, and more detail will be provided at a ""battery and powertrain investor day"" later this year. Musk said the company hopes to unveil its pickup truck this summer, commenting, ""I think it's the coolest car I've ever seen."""
165,0.9892,0.1,0.857,0.043,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk continued to deflect concerns about demand for the company's vehicles on Tuesday, during the electric-car company's annual shareholder meeting. ""I want to be clear: There is not a demand problem,"" Musk said.

Demand concerns from investors and some analysts have stemmed from worse-than-expected first-quarter deliveries. While management primarily blamed the quarter's underwhelming deliveries on challenges with shipping vehicles internationally, not all analysts bought the argument.

But Musk argues that demand for its vehicles (especially the Model 3) is not just healthy, but robust. Adding substance to his claims, Musk provided a few stats to drive home his point.

""Quarter-to-date, orders for Model S, X, and 3 are outpacing production,"" read one of the slides in Tesla's presentation. ""Sales have far exceeded production,"" Musk added. ""And production has been pretty good."" Musk went on to imply that Tesla has a decent shot at a record quarter for both production and deliveries. ""If not, it's going to be very close,"" he noted.

For some context, Tesla's previous record for production and deliveries was in the fourth quarter of last year, when the company produced 86,555 vehicles and delivered 90,966. Highlighting Tesla's staggering growth, 91,000 deliveries in Q2 would translate to 44% sequential and 123% year-over-year growth.

Importantly, Tesla's recent demand isn't dependent on the early adopters who made hundreds of thousands of reservations for the Model 3 when the vehicle was first announced. In fact, ""90% of orders are coming from non-reservation holders. So, these are new customers,"" Musk explained.

Musk also said the Model 3 outsold all similarly priced sedans combined in the U.S. over the last four quarters and boasted greater revenue domestically than any other car over that same time frame. This means the Model 3 is generating more revenue in the U.S. than popular lower-priced cars like the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord.

Tesla relies on word-of-mouth marketing

News of such strong demand for Model 3 in 2019 bodes well for the vehicle's long-term sales potential. While Tesla does spend money on various marketing initiatives, including test drive events, stores, and a sales force, its overall spending on customer acquisition remains low since Tesla doesn't spend any money on advertising.

The electric-car maker relies heavily on word-of-mouth marketing, which takes time to build momentum since customers with vehicles are the company's best brand evangelists. For instance, getting vehicles on the road was a key catalyst of Model S demand in 2013. ""Importantly, we are seeing orders in a particular region increase proportionate to the number of deliveries, which means that customers are selling other customers on the car,"" the company said in its first-quarter shareholder letter in 2013.

While awareness for Tesla vehicles was undoubtedly much lower in 2013 than it is today, it stands to reason that the more Model 3s there on the road, the greater the likelihood of someone new experiencing the vehicle.

Aided by growing Model 3 deliveries, Tesla expects to deliver 45% to 65% more vehicles in 2019 than it did in 2018."
166,0.9451,0.115,0.827,0.058,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) plunged 22.4% last month, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The electric car company sparked a plethora of headlines in May, most of them the negative kind.

So what

Tesla bears had a field day in May as the company slashed base prices on its higher-end Model S and Model X cars, followed by the announcement of a companywide cost-cutting program. Some critics saw this move as a sign that Tesla is inching closer to bankruptcy, while others took CEO Elon Musk at his word when he said that the company is less than a year away from sustainably positive profits. Many Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, led by Morgan Stanley dropping its worst-case valuation estimate from $97 per share all the way down to $10. The same firm also kept a $230 target price for the more likely ""base case"" scenario, settling for a hold rating overall.

Now what

At this point, Tesla's shares have absorbed a 36% beating in 52 weeks and a 43% drop over the last six months. This stock is not recommended for investors with a low tolerance for market risk, but Tesla still offers tremendous upside in the long run if the company manages to deliver on its lofty promises. From my point of view, this looks like a promising buy-in opportunity -- with plenty of speed bumps in the road ahead."
167,0.9132,0.076,0.886,0.038,"Investors in Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 21, 2019 $50.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.
What is Implied Volatility?
Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.
Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Tesla shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Tesla is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Automotive - Domestic industry that ranks in the Bottom 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 64 cents per share to a loss of 70 cents in that period.
Given the way analysts feel about Tesla right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

168,0.979,0.071,0.887,0.042,"Order and delivery activity has been bouncing back at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) since April -- at least in North America -- following a horrific start to 2019. This has put the electric vehicle pioneer in position to potentially beat its all-time quarterly record of 90,700 deliveries (set in Q4 2018) in the current quarter. For comparison, Tesla delivered just 63,000 vehicles in the first quarter.

However, Tesla isn't out of the woods yet. Its recent resurgence in orders and deliveries has been driven by unusual factors and could soon give way to another slump.

High hopes for the second quarter

Tesla experienced a sharp slowdown in sales in the first few months of 2019. Nevertheless, CEO Elon Musk remained confident that it was just a blip and that sales would climb to new highs once warmer weather arrived.

Recently, investors have received some good news in that regard. On June 5, Electrek reported that Tesla had delivered 33,000 vehicles in North America alone since the beginning of April, based on leaked information from a company insider. Tesla hopes to deliver another 33,000 in North America in June, according to Electrek. Even if that June goal proves unrealistic, Tesla still has a decent chance of surpassing 90,000 deliveries globally this quarter.

Wall Street analysts -- who may be a more neutral source of information -- agree that Tesla has seen a rebound in sales and deliveries. ""More Model 3s were registered in April and May than during all of the first quarter,"" wrote analysts at JMP Securities (via CNBC). Widely followed analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley concurred, estimating that Tesla sold 11,300 vehicles in the U.S. last month.

While there's a range of estimates about Tesla's orders and deliveries for the past two months, it seems clear that conditions have improved dramatically compared to last quarter. That said, this rebound may be short-lived.

Timing factors have boosted deliveries this quarter

Tesla's apparent jump in deliveries in April and May was driven by two unusual factors.

First, Tesla had about 10,600 vehicles in transit to customers at the end of last quarter, compared to fewer than 3,000 a quarter earlier. This total included many vehicles bound for customers in North America, due to the automaker's effort to deliver a massive number of cars in the last few days of the first quarter. Those vehicles were delivered in April instead. Had Tesla been able to squeeze in those deliveries during March as planned, the first quarter would have looked slightly less awful, but there wouldn't have been a surge in deliveries in April.

Second, Tesla finally began deliveries of the Model 3's long-awaited $35,000 base model in mid-April. To be fair, most buyers are opting for pricier versions, but Tesla has still gotten a boost this quarter from meeting pent-up demand for the cheapest version of the Model 3.

The Model 3 will never be as cheap as it is now

Bulls might respond to these caveats by noting that Tesla is selling vehicles at a record pace right now (at least according to Electrek). The $35,000 Model 3 has been available to order for months, so the recent rise in sales activity can't be written off as just a short spike related to pent-up demand.

However, that argument overlooks another key sales driver: changes in government subsidies. The federal tax credit for Tesla buyers dropped from $7,500 to $3,750 at the beginning of 2019, driving a spike in order activity in late 2018 followed by a lull to begin this year. That tax credit will fall by another 50% on July 1.

This means that U.S. buyers will never get a lower price on a Model 3 than they are getting today. Tesla was only selling pricier variants in 2018, when the full $7,500 federal tax credit was available. And the federal tax credit will decline by $1,875 after this month before phasing out entirely at the end of 2019.

In other words, this quarter was the best time to buy a Model 3 for anyone watching their wallet (at least in the U.S). As a result, it wouldn't be surprising to see the recent spike in order activity peter out over the next several weeks.

Beware a pause in Chinese demand

Selling the Model 3 in the U.S. is likely to be a lot harder during the second half of 2019 than it has been over the past few months. Unfortunately, Tesla will also struggle to sell vehicles in China -- arguably its most important international market -- over the next six months.

Tesla's sales already began to decline in China last year, due to the growing U.S.-China trade tensions. Tesla plans to sidestep Chinese tariffs on auto imports by opening a new factory in Shanghai soon. The company recently began taking orders for China-built Model 3s, with starting prices about 20% lower than for the imported versions. Deliveries of the locally built vehicles could possibly begin before year-end, but early 2020 is a more realistic target.

Building vehicles in China will dramatically improve Tesla's long-term competitiveness there, but it will crush demand in the near term. Hardly anyone will want to buy an imported Model 3 now when they will be able to get the same vehicle early next year at a much lower price.

It's encouraging to see Tesla's order activity and deliveries bouncing back after a terrible first quarter. However, Tesla will have to weather a few more tough quarters before potentially returning to full health -- and it remains vulnerable in the event of a broader industry downturn."
169,0.9958,0.106,0.869,0.024,"With solar panels costing a fraction of what they did several years ago, more and more communities, businesses, and homeowners are going solar. With that in mind, we asked three of our Motley Fool contributors what solar stocks they're keeping on their watchlists. They came back with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR). Here's why they think you should keep an eye on these three.

Disrupting the industry...maybe

John Bromels (Tesla): Not too long ago, Tesla used to be the top installer of residential solar systems in the U.S., thanks to its purchase of SolarCity. Unfortunately, the SolarCity acquisition hasn't worked out very well for Tesla. The company's much-anticipated solar roof -- essentially photovoltaic shingles that replace a shingled roof -- has failed to materialize beyond a few test installations. Last year, Tesla pulled out of a partnership with Home Depot that was responsible for about half of Tesla's solar sales.

But then, in late April, several news outlets reported that Tesla was planning to start selling rooftop solar systems for 38% to 41% less than the national average in a bid to increase sales. A stunned market sold off share s of other solar installers as it envisioned price wars decimating profits. As it turns out, there was a bit of a miscalculation, and Tesla's systems would be up to 16% cheaper than the national average, not 41%. Tesla plans to make the pricing work by standardizing its systems and forcing customers to order online.

""Up to 16%"" is a far cry from ""38% to 41%,"" and certainly Tesla has a history of making bold claims that then turn out to be inaccurate. But with solar panels getting cheaper every year, it's possible that Tesla could make solar installations profitable at that lower price point, which would certainly disrupt the industry. It's worth keeping an eye on Tesla to see if this new pricing strategy bears fruit in a hotly competitive industry.

A solar company on the cusp of profit

Rich Smith (Enphase): Enphase isn't the best-known solar stock. But in reviewing competitive threats to another solar stock that I like -- SolarEdge Technologies -- I noticed that it named Enphase as a ""microinverter manufacturer"" competing with its own business of selling solar inverters (which convert solar energy into usable electric current). My Foolish colleague Jason Hall, incidentally, recently called out both SolarEdge and Enphase as "" key solar suppliers with multiple ways to grow.""

""Hmm,"" thought I. ""Maybe Enphase deserves a place on my watchlist, too?"" Maybe it deserves a place on your watchlist as well?

I want to emphasize that I am not saying Enphase is a stock to buy...yet. In contrast to SolarEdge, Enphase hasn't ever earned a full-year profit. But in each of the past two quarters, the company was profitable. Moreover, Enphase generated positive free cash flow (FCF) in each of the past five quarters. FCF for the past 12 months is now a very respectable $26 million.

Admittedly, even this amount of free cash flow means Enphase stock costs a whopping 67 times trailing FCF -- much more expensive than SolarEdge. But analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect to see Enphase grow strongly over the next few years, and they predict 2019 will be the company's first profitable year, and that Enphase will grow its GAAP profits by more than 50% (to $0.52 per diluted share) in 2020.

Given that profitability is imminent, it seems to me 2019 isn't too early to add this solar stock to your watchlist.

Keep this one on the watchlist, but don't buy at just any price

Tyler Crowe (First Solar): 2019 looks like it is off to a great start for solar panel manufacturer First Solar. Year to date, the company's stock is up more than 35%. That gain is coming off some real ups and downs over the past few years, though, and over the past five years, the stock is down 6.8%.

Numbers like this aren't encouraging, but it is an important lesson when thinking about investing in the solar industry. It is cyclical, it is intensely competitive, and growth of the industry doesn't necessarily translate to stock gains.

One of the things that has held back First Solar's stock more than anything else over the years is the constant need to reinvest in new technology and then retool to manufacture these new technologies at scale. Over the past few years, the company has been in the middle of a massive turnover at its factory to manufacture its most recent set of panels, Series 6. That process is almost complete, but the costs of doing so resulted in First Solar swinging to a loss this past quarter.

The good news is that First Solar is one of the best-run businesses in the solar industry. It still has loads of cash on the balance sheet to invest in new technologies and whatever the solar market throws its way over the next few years. That said, investors should be apprehensive about buying this stock after such a large stock gain. Until it can show growth throughout the cycle, investors should be incredibly selective when buying this stock."
170,0.9919,0.101,0.846,0.052,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk made a big claim at the company's Autonomy Day in April, telling investors to expect a million self-driving taxis on the road sometime next year. That's really ambitious, even by Musk's standards.

Tesla was supposed to put a fully self-driving vehicle on the road by 2017. It missed that deadline, and don't be surprised to see it missing the next one as well -- Musk's plan to put so many robotaxis on the roads in the space of just eighteen months will hit regulatory hurdles, along with competition from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Waymo's slow but steady steps to expand its own ridesharing business.

Waymo makes actual progress while the Tesla news circus continues

Alphabet's self-driving division Waymo has been a leader in the autonomous driving space. Its cars have racked up millions of miles on public roads, leaving the others way behind.

So it was logical for Waymo to commercially launch its self-driving service in the Phoenix metro area late last year. However, the commercial launch of the Waymo One self-driving taxi service came with certain limitations, such as a requirement that a test driver be present and that operational ability be limited to a fixed radius.

Despite having a massive technological lead over rivals, Waymo decided to play it safe in the beginning. So Musk's belief that Teslas will soon start driving themselves all on their own by next year -- helping owners make as much as $30,000 a year by renting out their vehicles -- seems far-fetched.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that fully automated safety features can be expected in cars only after 2025. This seems logical, as autonomous cars will have to undergo extensive testing before they are deemed fit to drive autonomously -- after all, there will be lives at stake when cars start driving on their own.

But Tesla hasn't tested its self-driving vehicles extensively just yet like Waymo has done. And Tesla cars don't have an impeccable safety record either: The cars have been involved in fatal crashes, even with the autopilot system engaged.

This is why expecting Tesla to get a green light from regulators to get a million robotaxis on the road by next year is likely nothing more than a pipe dream. But we can't say the same for Waymo -- the Alphabet subsidiary now seems to be on track to expand its robotaxi business thanks to its latest partnership.

Alphabet takes another step toward monetizing its autonomous tech

Waymo has expanded its self-driving taxi program in Phoenix by tying up with Lyft. The ridesharing company's customers can call for a Waymo self-driving car using Lyft's app, though there will be safety drivers behind the wheels of those cars.

The service is limited for now, as only 10 Waymo vehicles are available for Lyft customers in selected towns around the Phoenix area. But despite its limited scope, this is a big step forward because it shows us the future of the self-driving industry.

One of the biggest challenges that the likes of Lyft and Uber face is keeping their drivers happy. Uber recently cut driver compensation by 25%, and has reportedly been blocking drivers' accounts. Given that Uber reportedly loses an average of 58 cents on each ride, it is probably being forced to take steps to cut costs.

Reducing drivers' pay is one way these ridesharing companies can achieve that. But such a move is bound to run into opposition, as the recent driver strike shows.

This is where Waymo comes into play with its self-driving taxis. It can tie up with more ridesharing companies, supplying them with autonomous vehicles that could drive on their own and take the human element out of the equation.

Not surprisingly, Waymo is now looking to set up a factory in Detroit to make self-driving cars, which could be considered a precursor to a wider launch of its robotaxi service.

Tesla, on the other hand, has a much simpler plan -- sending a software update to its cars to equip them with self-driving capabilities. Musk believes he can leapfrog the others in autonomous driving tech with such a move. But don't be surprised if Waymo, with its slow and steady approach, takes the cake by tying up with the very companies that Musk plans to compete against."

Shares of electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped on Thursday, rising as much as 7.3%. As of 12:43 p.m. EDT, the stock was up about 5%.

The stock's gain is likely due to a report that vehicle deliveries for the electric-car company are going well in North America, potentially setting the company up for a record quarter.

So what

In the first two months of Q2, Tesla delivered 33,000 vehicles in North America, Electrek reported Wednesday night. The electric car-focused news website said this info was leaked from a call executives held with sales and delivery managers at the company.

Now the company is aiming to deliver 33,000 more vehicles in the final month of the quarter, Electrek reports. To encourage its sales and delivery teams to hit this target, the company is offering performance bonuses.

Now what

Such robust deliveries in North America would likely position Tesla for record quarterly deliveries when combined with the company's deliveries outside of North America during the period.

Tesla guided for 90,000 to 100,000 deliveries in its second quarter. The company's previous quarterly record for deliveries was just below 91,000 vehicles. Deliveries above this level in Q2 would represent more than 120% year-over-year growth."
172,0.9877,0.092,0.892,0.016,"Late last month, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk told employees that demand was ""strong"" for the company's vehicles, and urged them to ""execute well"" and help it achieve a new quarterly record for deliveries. Now, there's another piece of positive news about its recent sales: Deliveries in North America are seeing notable momentum, Electrek reported Wednesday night.

The automaker's ability to boost its second-quarter delivery numbers will be key, as it's targeting a 45% to 65% increase in vehicle deliveries for the full year. How it fares this quarter will be especially important given its Q1 sales flop, when challenges with delivering vehicles outside of North America led to a lower-than-expected delivery total.

Aiming for 66,000 deliveries in North America

In a call with sales and delivery managers on Wednesday, Tesla executives told employees the company had already delivered 33,000 vehicles in North America so far in Q2, ""sources familiar with the matter"" told Electrek. In addition, the company is aiming to deliver an additional 33,000 vehicles in the market during the final month of the quarter (June), Electrek said.

To incentivize sales and a high volume of deliveries, the company is offering a $1,200 bonus to every sales employee and a $550 bonus to every delivery employee if the automaker delivers 33,000 vehicles in June. In addition, if deliveries hit 36,000 during the month, Tesla will double these bonuses, the sources said.

Already in June, Tesla has delivered more than 2,500 vehicles, scheduled 10,000 more deliveries, and has 6,000 orders about to have a scheduled delivery, Electrek reported.

While Tesla doesn't typically break out its quarterly deliveries by geography, the automaker did say it delivered 63,359 Model 3 vehicles to customers in North America during its fourth quarter -- the period in which the electric-car maker set a record for total quarterly vehicle deliveries. Presumably, a significant portion of the 27,607 combined Model S and X deliveries during Q4 were also delivered in North America. This means fourth-quarter North America deliveries were likely well ahead of what Tesla appears on track for in Q2.

But the automaker has significantly ramped up international Model 3 shipments since its fourth quarter. Including international Model 3 deliveries during Q2, Wednesday's news about the company's sales momentum in North America suggests the automaker could see record deliveries this quarter.

Impressive momentum

Beating its fourth-quarter delivery record of 91,000 vehicles would solidify the company's incredible momentum, as trailing-12-month deliveries would be up nearly 160% year over year.

In Tesla's first-quarter shareholder letter, management was confident the company was on track to hit its full-year guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries. ""With the recently announced product improvements on Model S and Model X, as well as continued expansion of Model 3 globally, we expect our order rate to continue to increase throughout the year as our production levels increase,"" the company said in its first-quarter shareholder letter.

Investors will find out whether management maintains this rosy outlook for demand and production when the company reports second-quarter deliveries early next month."
173,0.9814,0.166,0.797,0.036,"What happened

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose on Tuesday, gaining as much as 7%. As of 1 p.m. EDT, the stock was up 6%.

The stock's gain is likely fueled by a number of factors, including analyst commentary, gains for growth stocks on Tuesday, and more.

So what

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reiterated an equal-weight rating and a $230 price target on Tuesday. The 12-month price target is notably more than 20% higher where shares are trading today, signaling meaningful upside for the stock.

Tesla's gain on Tuesday also follows a sharp year-to-date decline for the stock. Shares are down 43% so far -- even after today's gain. Some investors, therefore, may believe shares have been oversold.

Finally, it's an overall positive day for growth stocks, as many of them recovered by a few percentage points on Tuesday after being beat down amid trade war concerns. Tesla's rise today could be partly attributable to this market bullishness.

Now what

The near-term concern for Tesla investors to keep an eye on will be demand for the company's vehicles. The electric-car maker forecast vehicle sales to rise 45% to 65% year over year in 2019. While growing Model 3 production suggests supply will be sufficient enough for Tesla to meet this target, it's unclear whether demand will be robust enough."
174,0.9984,0.132,0.823,0.045,"There is probably no bigger battleground stock today than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The Elon Musk-led electric-car maker garners fierce reactions from both sides of the investing aisle. Bulls say that Tesla will not only produce superior vehicles, but also change the entire transportation system, while bears focus on the company's underwhelming first quarter, incoming competition, stretched balance sheet, and Musk's unconventional behavior.

One of the more prominent Tesla bulls is ARK Invest, which manages the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT:ARKK), among other specialized ETFs focused on next-generation disruption. ARK had previously put forth a bull case for Tesla of $4,000 per share, which it just upped to a staggering $5,905. That is, needless to say, significantly higher than the $190 per share price tag today. That price target is largely due to Tesla's opportunity in the autonomous robo-taxi industry, but given that that business doesn't exist today, those assumptions may be a tad aggressive.

However, even ARK's ""bear"" case calls for a valuation of $590 to $1,200 per share just based on the electric vehicle opportunity alone. ARK, to its credit, was good enough to put its valuation model up on Github. But upon looking over the model, I'd say that Tesla bulls had better hope the autonomous robo-taxi business comes to fruition, because there's a pretty big hole in the ""auto-only"" bear case. Here is what I took issue with.

ARK's assumptions are OK

I'm not quibbling with any of ARK Invest's assumptions going into the model. In its ""bear case,"" ARK projects Tesla selling 1.7 million vehicles in 2023, which ARK estimates would be around 11% of its estimated 26.4 million-car EV market at that time.

For reference, 86 million cars were sold worldwide in 2018, so ARK is proposing that EVs make significant headway from their single-digit market share of overall car sales today. That EV market growth projection is more aggressive than some believe, but ARK Invest believes it will happen due to battery cost declines. If that does happen, ARK's market share estimates may actually be considered fairly conservative, as Tesla currently has 17% of the current EV market.

ARK also projects a $48,250 average selling price, along with 25% gross margins. Those projections may be a tad aggressive, but not totally unreasonable, considering Tesla has 18.3% gross margins today.

A curious methodology

So, what's wrong with ARK's model? It comes down to how it values the company. ARK uses a curious metric called enterprise value (EV) to EBITDAR&D, which is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, research and development.

That's a lot of exclusions!

ARK uses an 8 times 2023 EBITDAR&D multiple to value Tesla's car segment, slightly higher than the 7.3x average multiple for auto companies today.

This may not be the way to think about it

Now, many analysts use EBITDA as a metric for valuing companies, though investors should not think for one second that EBITDA is the same thing as operating cash flow. Businesses usually need to reinvest in their factories and technical capabilities just to stand still -- especially capital-intensive businesses like autos. That's why Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger hate using EBITDA has a valuation metric.

Admittedly, in technology companies or biotechs, it is a prudent idea to capitalize R&D. Their main investment in future growth comes from research and development. Just as with any asset, the research and development asset should be depreciated over time. If the company is growing, a chunk of current R&D could be considered ""growth"" investment and thus a form of capital spending.

But notice I said part of R&D spending. It's unlikely -- if not impossible -- that Tesla would ever bring its research and development budget down to zero. In fact, Tesla structurally has much higher R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue than its auto peers.

ARK models Tesla spending 13% of its revenue on R&D, as opposed to just 4.3% for the average car company. Therefore, by capitalizing R&D, ARK is ""putting back"" much more into the EBITDAR&D figure for Tesla than for its rivals. Basically, this valuation metric makes Tesla's profitability look much better relative to its peers.

Consider this -- ARK's model estimates 2023 EBITDAR&D at $14.9 billion, but operating income that same year at only $2 billion. Even if you capitalize the R&D, if 2023 R&D is viewed as a necessary capital investment, it should have the same impact on free cash flow as an immediate expense would.

So while ARK's 8x EBITDAR&D ""sounds"" reasonable, its 2023 $119 billion enterprise value estimate equates to almost 60 times operating income! I'm not sure about you, but I'd never pay 60 times operating income for a relatively mature automobile company. For comparison, current auto leaders such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and BMW (OTC:BMWY.Y) tend to have have EV-to-EBIT ratios in the mid-teens, so if, say, one puts a (generous) 20x EV to EBIT multiple on that $2 billion in 2023 operating income, Tesla's enterprise value comes down to $40 billion, a tad less than the current $44 billion EV today.

That doesn't mean the Tesla thesis is dead

Now notice that I'm not taking issue with ARK's bull case, which suggests that a fully autonomous robo-taxi service that could lift Tesla's share price into the multi-thousands. That's not because I think it's right; it's just that nobody has seen a mature autonomous taxi service, and thus its cash flows. Admittedly, Tesla does have some very exciting technology around autonomous driving, which could give it an advantage over Waymo and Cruise. And who knows? Such a service could very well be worth hundreds of billions of dollars one day.

However, this is a futuristic project that hasn't come to market yet. In fact, Consumer Reports just panned the current version of Tesla's autopilot, so ARK's bull case isn't automatic, to say the least.

My main quibble remains with the non-autonomous taxi, auto-only valuation of $590 to $1,200 per share. As shown above, that type of thinking requires a ludicrous multiple on a mature auto company. Therefore, don't buy Tesla for the car thesis alone. It needs to disrupt the mobility industry (and maybe others) for the bull case to pan out."
175,0.9876,0.092,0.875,0.033,"Following the market's close on Wednesday, a fresh story broke about Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) attempts to keep up its workforce's morale. The company's always-talkative CEO, Elon Musk, once again had something to say directly to them.

Company results also made some post-closing headlines. Two companies reported their latest quarters as the sun began to drop in the sky.

Musk mollifies Tesla troops

Elon Musk clearly wants to calm the nerves of Tesla employees. In the second instance in as many weeks, the high-profile CEO sent an email to his workforce reassuring them that the company was on the right track. Not only that, he said it's poised to set a new all-time high for quarterly deliveries.

According to a report from Bloomberg, directly quoting the email, Musk admitted that ""[w]hile our demand is strong, we have a lot of vehicle deliveries to catch up to in order to have a successful quarter,"" referring to the company's current Q2. This seems like an attempt to reassure Tesla's troops that growth is on deck, despite the very disappointing deliveries figure Tesla posted in Q1 that has badly affected its stock.

Although the company has estimated that its delivery total will be in the range of 90,000 to 100,000 automobiles this quarter, many analysts and pundits believe the actual number will be significantly lower. Tesla's record for quarterly deliveries is 90,700.

Reiterating an assessment he made in that previous email to employees, Musk proclaimed that ""if we execute well, Q2 will be an all-time record for Tesla vehicle deliveries and an awesome victory!!""

If post-market traders are swapping Tesla shares on the basis of this new email, they aren't overly convinced by Musk's words. The company's stock is trading flat at the moment.

Palo Alto Networks wheels, deals, and reports

It was certainly a busy day in the California headquarters of cybersecurity purveyor Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). Following the market's closing bell, the company announced its latest quarterly results, plus a pair of fresh acquisitions.

For the company's Q3 of fiscal 2019, it booked revenue of almost $727 million, which was 28% higher on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted net income came in at just over $130 million ($1.31 per share), beating the Q3 2018 result by 30%. Both line items beat the average analyst expectations, in addition to the company's own estimates.

Yet Palo Alto Networks' forward guidance for profitability has come up short. The company says it expects to book earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41 to $1.42 for the current Q4. Analysts, however, were modeling $1.55.

Palo Alto Networks also announced it had made a pair of deals. It signed agreements to purchase Twistlock, a container security specialist, and PureSec, which is described as ""a global leader in serverless architectures security."" Palo Alto Networks will pay roughly $410 million in cash for Twistlock; it is not disclosing the terms of the PureSec deal. Both companies are privately held.

Investors seem spooked by the latest news, most likely about that Q4 profitability estimate. Palo Alto Networks stock is down by 5% in after-hours trading.

Veeva Systems beats, but slides

Elsewhere in the tech results sphere, Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) unveiled its Q1 of 2020 following market close.

The quarter saw the specialist cloud services provider increase its revenue by 25% on a year-over-year basis, to almost $245 million, on the back of subscription revenue that rose 27%. On the bottom line, Veeva netted just under $79 million ($0.50 EPS) in adjusted profit for a 53% improvement.

On average, analysts had expected the company to book approximately $238 million in revenue and a per-share adjusted net profit of $0.44.

For the full year, Veeva raised its guidance. It's now anticipating a top line of $1.045 billion to $1.050 billion, with adjusted EPS of $2.01 to $2.03. Both ranges are higher than the average $1.04 billion and $1.92, respectively, projected by prognosticators.

Might this stock be suffering from Earnings Beat Fatigue? Veeva's a strong performer that has topped EPS estimates in its last five quarters -- perhaps the market is no longer impressed by these victories. At the moment, the stock is down by almost 4% in late-hours action."
176,0.8568,0.058,0.921,0.021,"Electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is planning a surprise announcement in China on Friday, May 31, according to a Tesla post on Weibo, a Chinese social network. A day later, Tesla launched an online contest in China for people to guess the price of the made-in-China Model 3 -- suggesting the mysterious announcement has something to do with a Chinese version of the vehicle.

This planned announcement comes as Tesla is making significant progress on its Gigafactory Shanghai -- a factory for building Model 3 vehicles in Shanghai. The automaker hopes building vehicles in the country will reduce costs for Model 3 in the important market while increasing global production and deliveries.

Bringing Model 3 to China

Tesla's Gigafactory Shanghai is a massive undertaking that Tesla started to construct in January. Initially, the company is aiming for Model 3 production of 3,000 units per week in China. But Tesla doesn't expect to reach volume production of the vehicle until sometime between the fourth quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2020.

""Local manufacturing is an essential component of our ability to provide to customers in the region a truly affordable version of Model 3,"" Tesla explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter.

According to management's commentary on its Gigafactory Shanghai in Tesla's first-quarter shareholder letter, the China-based Model 3 production line will come online faster and more efficiently than the line at the company's factory in Fremont, California. ""Learning from our experience, we can now build a second-generation Model 3 line in China that we expect will be at least 50% cheaper per unit of capacity than our Model 3-related lines in Fremont and at Gigafactory 1,"" Tesla said.

With Tesla planning a special announcement in China this week, it's possible that the automaker is planning to launch a version of Model 3 with specifications catering to the local market.

A key catalyst

It's no surprise Tesla is investing heavily in the country. Not only is China the world's largest auto market but it's been the source of a large portion of Tesla's growth in recent years. Revenue in China in 2018 was $1.8 billion, or 8% of total revenue. While revenue from China was higher in 2017, at $2 billion, the market's revenue was only $1.1 billion in 2016 and $319 million in 2015.

Further, a local market will not only help reduce manufacturing costs but help Tesla bypass Chinese import tariffs, making the Model 3 as competitive as possible when it comes to price."
177,0.9732,0.091,0.858,0.051,"In a leaked email to employees (via Electrek) on Wednesday, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) revealed it still has some catch-up work to do on achieving its goal to deliver a record number of vehicles during its second quarter. The email also emphasized Tesla's ongoing cost-cutting efforts as the company aims to move closer to becoming sustainably profitable.

But the most interesting line in the email was likely one that had nothing to do with vehicle production rates, delivery logistics, or cost-cutting measures. It was CEO Elon Musk's take on orders for its vehicles.

""[D]emand is strong,"" Musk said in the email.

These are important words following a quarter in which deliveries fell sharply, both sequentially and compared to Tesla's guidance for a massive increase in deliveries in 2019 compared to 2018.

Tesla's unclear demand story

After Tesla whiffed on its first-quarter deliveries, and in light of several recent price reductions to its vehicle lineup, there has been some concern on the Street about demand for the electric-car company's vehicles.

Notably, Tesla said its worse-than-expected first-quarter deliveries were primarily due to troubles shipping vehicles overseas, as well as a pull-forward in demand in the fourth quarter as buyers anticipated the Jan. 1, 2019, reduction in the electric vehicle federal tax credit. To this end, the company did end Q1 with significantly more vehicles in transit to customers than it had at the end of Q4. Further, management maintained its full-year outlook for vehicle deliveries when it reported its first-quarter results.

Nevertheless, there hasn't been any notable evidence of growing demand. Sure, trailing-12-month vehicle deliveries are up 158% year over year. But the Model 3 launched to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of reservations, making it unclear how many orders are new and how many are from aging reservations.

Musk's take on demand for Tesla's vehicles in Wednesday's leaked email, therefore, is a good sign that demand is on track.

""While our demand is strong, we have a lot of vehicle deliveries to catch up to in order to have a successful quarter,"" said Musk in the email. For Tesla to achieve a new record, it will need to deliver about 91,000 vehicles or more during the second quarter. This would represent a 123% year-over-year increase in deliveries and a 44% sequential increase.

Look for a more detailed explanation

Of course, investors will want more information than what Musk said in this email to have more confidence in the company's long-term demand story. But this is promising news in the meantime, as Musk shouldn't be calling demand strong unless he thinks Tesla is on track to achieve its full-year guidance for deliveries in 2019 to rise 45% to 65% year over year.

Investors should look for more commentary on demand for Tesla's vehicles when the company releases its second-quarter vehicle delivery update. This report usually comes out within three calendar days of the quarter's end; the last day of Tesla's second quarter is June 30."
178,-0.8214,0.062,0.855,0.083,"It's not a surprise to see nearly 600 stocks hitting fresh lows this past week. The Dow has been sliding for five weeks in a row, and investors are nervous about the fallout from the trade tariffs battle with China and signs that the once-hot economy is starting to slow.

Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Blue Apron Holdings (NYSE:APRN) are among the big-name stocks hitting 52-week lows last week. Let's go over the reasons why things have gone wrong for these three former market darlings.

Weibo

Growth is decelerating sharply at China's leading social site. Revenue rose 14% in last week's quarterly report. Most companies would love to be checking in with double-digit top-line growth, but we've now see Weibo's revenue growth slow for six consecutive quarters. The deceleration has been brutal. This streak started with an 81% revenue surge in the third quarter of 2017, and Weibo has yet to hit rock bottom. Its guidance for the current quarter stunned investors, targeting just 7% in growth on the top line.

At least two analyst soured on Weibo following the report. HSBC downgraded the stock from hold to reduce, the equivalent of a sell rating. Fawne Jiang slashed her price target on Weibo from $81 to $51, noting the ad slowdown that's stinging other popular Chinese online destinations.

Tesla Motors

The worst performer among Nasdaq 100 components this year is Tesla, plummeting 43% this year. The stock has now eaten into its previous two years of gains, trading at its lowest level since late 2016.

There are plenty of things holding Tesla back these days. The older Model S and Model X vehicles have seen their combined deliveries dip year over year as well as sequentially. The new entry-level Model 3 has also seen its deliveries slip sequentially, and recent pricing swings to stir demand or adjust for rising costs aren't working or helping. Wall Street pros have also been lowering their price targets as they brace for the new normal.

Blue Apron

The meal-kit provider has been going hungry for a long time. Revenue had declined for six straight quarters, eating into any momentum that Blue Apron may have had when it went public two summers ago. The latest dagger came early last week when Blue Apron put up a reverse stock split for a shareholder vote.

With Blue Apron's stock price falling to the point where it needs to artificially inflate it in order to meet exchange listing requirements, a reverse stock split isn't a surprise. However, investors have seen how, more often than not, a stock going for a reverse split continues to slide."
179,0.9361,0.089,0.861,0.05,"Analysts figure they’ve given enough rope to Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) to hang itself. This week, at least three of them (from Citigoup, Morgan Stanley and Wedbush) issued decidedly negative reports on the company. This isn’t a difficult thing to do at all given its eccentric CEO and his determination to remain in control despite burning away billions in cash and sending Tesla deeper and deeper into debt.

So Musk continues to make lofty promises of becoming a robo taxi company when the auto business itself is still struggling. He is still short of his promised delivery targets. While January-to-March production totaled 63,000 (about 5,250 a week), the company says it is doing 900 Model 3 cars a day now with 7,000 vehicles per week on the horizon. Tesla’s forecast calls for 360,000-400,000 units by year end, so 7,000 a week for the remainder of the year could get Tesla within sniffing distance of that target.

Even if the company manages to reach that target by some miracle, there’s a question of profitability. The federal tax credit started phasing out in January leaving Musk looking for ways to lower car prices any way it could. Since Tesla is still in the process of ramping up production, this is no easy task. So a referral program had to be scrapped and store closures had to give way to online sales. An even after all that, Model S prices, promised at $35,000 now cost $42,900.

Profitability (it lost $702 million in the first quarter) or at least breakeven is extremely important for the company, which is now looking to cut costs any which way it can. But there seems to be some doubt about its ability to get there, because Musk had to promise investors a new revenue stream (robotaxis, by 2020 no less) in order to get them to cough up another $2 billion this month. At the current cash burn rate, the company will burn through the cash in 10 months.

If all this wasn’t negative enough, there’s significant competition out there. Volkswagen (VWAGY - Free Report) for instance is setting up two Chinese factories that will churn out 600,000 electric vehicles (EVs) a month. The goal is to produce 70 battery-powered models across its 12 auto brands by 2028 to make 22 million EVs over the next decade. All the traditional automakers have much more experience (can design new models far easier and go to market with them).

Tesla in comparison has barely 2 beautiful models (Model Y is still in the tooling/blueprinting phase), its own battery and some nice technology. Moreover, the flagship China factory it is building may become a victim in the trade war.

As far as its chances of entering the $500 billion robo taxi market next year to compete with Uber (UBER - Free Report) and Lyft (LYFT - Free Report) is concerned, let’s just say that the chances are slim. The National Transportation Safety Board NTSB reported this week that its autopilot system was involved in yet another fatal crash.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives says it well: ""With a code red situation at Tesla, Musk & Co. are expanding into insurance, robotaxis, and other sci-fi projects/endeavors when the company instead should be laser focused on shoring up core demand for Model 3 and simplifying its business model and expense structure in our opinion with headwinds abound.""

180,-0.992,0.066,0.818,0.116,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been a battleground stock for many years. But for most of 2019 -- and especially the past couple of months -- the news has been almost all bad.

As a result, Tesla shares have lost nearly half of their value since mid-December. Last week, the stock broke below the $200 mark for the first time since late 2016. Some Wall Street experts are now saying that Tesla may need to restructure or even declare bankruptcy in the face of falling demand for its electric vehicles.

Does this mean Tesla is doomed? Let's take a look.

Demand is sagging

Warning signs have been piling up for Tesla investors since the beginning of the year. The first sign that something was amiss was when Tesla implemented multiple price changes for its vehicle lineup during the first quarter. This seemed to suggest that demand was fading.

These fears were confirmed in early April. Tesla reported that it delivered just 63,000 vehicles in the quarter, down from more than 90,000 a quarter earlier. Most troublingly, the company delivered just 12,100 of its highly profitable Model S and Model X vehicles in the period -- down 56% sequentially and down 44% year over year.

It was inevitable that this would negatively impact Tesla's earnings, but the damage was even worse than what most expected. Tesla posted a Q1 loss of $4.10 per share -- $2.90 per share excluding stock-based compensation -- and it used up $1.5 billion of its $3.7 billion cash stash, between its negative free cash flow and the repayment of $920 million of debt. This gave the company little choice but to raise more capital in early May.

There have been more troubling signs in the past month. On May 16, CEO Elon Musk sent an email to all employees, asking them to ""examine every expenditure at Tesla no matter how small"" to find savings. This could be a simple attempt to maximize efficiency. However, in the past, Tesla's radical cost-savings plans have been correlated with big losses. (For example, the company abruptly decided to shutter most of its retail locations in the midst of its poor financial performance last quarter.) So the latest cost-saving plan doesn't bode well.

Even more recently, Consumer Reports panned Tesla's Autopilot system, saying it's not close to being ready for prime time. This further emphasizes that Musk's prediction of fully self-driving Teslas being on the road by the end of next year is preposterous.

The first quarter may have been unusually tough

As bad as the recent news has been, Tesla may not be in as much danger as some bears believe. First, the big loss and rapid cash burn last quarter were exacerbated by the timing of deliveries during the period. About 10,600 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter -- and thus delivered early in Q2 -- compared to fewer than 3,000 a quarter earlier.

The resulting decrease in revenue and increase in inventory hurt Tesla's first-quarter earnings and cash flow. That timing impact should at least partially reverse this quarter.

Second, during Tesla's earnings call last month, Musk opined that order activity would accelerate over the course of 2019. There's been some evidence of that so far. A recent leaked email apparently from Musk stated that Tesla had already surpassed 50,000 net new vehicle orders since the beginning of the second quarter. That puts it on pace for perhaps 90,000 net new orders in the quarter, which lines up with the low end of its deliveries guidance.

Together, these two factors suggest that Tesla will achieve much better earnings and cash flow in the second quarter than it did a quarter ago. (Whether it actually generates positive free cash flow is less clear.)

However, U.S. Tesla buyers will face another drop in the federal tax credit as of July 1, which could hurt the company's sales momentum. Meanwhile, by the end of this quarter, Tesla will have met most of the initial surge of Model 3 demand in international markets. As a result, the growth that the company is counting on in the second half of 2019 may not materialize.

Two things could decide Tesla's fate

The evidence isn't clear-cut one way or the other, but demand for Tesla's three current vehicles seems to be plateauing short of the 500,000-per-year mark that the company has long targeted. Additionally, Tesla has had to significantly reduce prices for the Model S and Model X, while Model 3 demand is normalizing toward more affordable variants, pressuring margins.

Barring another sharp drop in demand, bankruptcy probably isn't a big risk at this point. That said, Tesla isn't necessarily on track for a return to profitability at any point in 2019.

That means the Tesla bull case increasingly relies on two future developments: the opening of Tesla's new factory in China and the launch of the Model Y. Building vehicles in China will reduce costs and allow Tesla to sidestep a massive tariff bill. That could potentially enable lower prices, stimulating sales. Meanwhile, the Model Y compact crossover could become far more popular than the Model 3, as demand has shifted dramatically from cars to crossovers.

In theory, the China factory should open in late 2019, and Model Y production should begin in late 2020. However, Tesla has a long track record of missing deadlines.

With the company having no clear path to sustainable profitability with its current products in its current markets, missing these deadlines could pose grave risks to Tesla."
181,0.9158,0.116,0.789,0.095,"Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) acquisition of SolarCity has been an abject failure by almost any measure. Solar didn't end up rounding out the product offering for EV buyers; it only hurt Tesla's balance sheet, and the companies have already abandoned the idea of selling solar through retail stores.

At this point, Tesla would be better off selling or spinning off its solar business. The problem is, it might be too late to do that.

Solar no longer makes sense at Tesla

When Tesla bought SolarCity, it did so on a few assumptions. One was that moving solar sales into Tesla showrooms would lower sales costs, allowing Tesla to either generate more profit or lower prices to grow the business. Tesla also said that EV buyers would be highly likely to go solar, especially with SolarCity's no-money-down financing options. Under the Tesla brand, solar would easily thrive, and Elon Musk promised that building an integrated clean energy company was part of the master plan.

Not only was Tesla supposed to be good for solar, the combination of solar, EVs, and energy storage were supposed to create the energy company of the future. Energy storage was the product that tied everything together, smartly optimizing when solar energy would be used and ensuring that the Tesla in the garage was always full of electrons.

Last but not least was the solar roof, which was announced just before the SolarCity acquisition closed. This was supposed to be the futuristic roofing product that would attract a whole new generation of customers to Tesla's solar products. Who wouldn't want a roof that was more durable than one made of standard material, cost less over the long term, and generated electricity?

The problem is, none of those ideas have worked out for Tesla. Sales in showrooms have been a disaster, as evidenced by Tesla's shrinking installations and market share. EV customers haven't adopted solar or energy storage at a clip to build a sustainable business. And the solar roof has installations that can be measured in the dozens nearly three years after the product was announced. Nothing about solar under Tesla's umbrella has worked out, and it no longer makes sense for the company to continue down a failing path.

Where does Tesla solar go from here?

There aren't a lot of great options for Tesla's current solar business. It could be spun off into a separate company again, but the company would install fewer than half of the rooftop projects SolarCity did when it was public, so its value to investors may be low. The entity would also have billions in debt obligations, which Tesla would love to get off its balance sheet but public investors may not like to see. Given how poorly the solar business has been run under Tesla, separating would likely create a better business, but solar could have a rocky start if it were to be spun off right now.

Tesla could also sell even more of its solar assets and cash flows. This might raise some capital, but when assets like this were sold by SunPower it resulted in a large loss because of the way assets are valued on the balance sheet at a lower discount rate than what the market will bear. Selling assets may be the best option while Tesla is still in the solar business, but it wouldn't solve the core problems Tesla has in solar.

It may sound crazy, but shutting down the solar business may be a wise option given the alternatives. Tesla is probably losing money on solar today given low gross margins and high sales costs in the solar industry. The company could keep energy storage products and partner with SunPower, Sunrun, and/or Vivint Solar to sell the Powerwall, which would likely help grow the storage business overall because these companies have larger market shares than Tesla. One of the companies may even be interested in the Buffalo manufacturing plant that Tesla acquired with SolarCity.

There aren't many good options for Tesla's solar business, but given what a drag it is on operations and the distraction it must be for management, getting out of solar now would be good for the car company in the long run."
182,0.9986,0.138,0.789,0.073,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bears are rejoicing.

Shares of the electric-vehicle maker fell to below $200 for the first time in more than two years, as the company got thwacked by a series of negative analyst notes and concerns about the company's liquidity after CEO Elon Musk warned his staff that Tesla would be out of cash in 10 months if it didn't make ""hardcore"" cost cuts. Questions about demand for the company's cars have also arisen following a recent price cut.

Tesla bears responded enthusiastically, calling for the company's demise across social media and elsewhere. The stock has long been a polarizing one. 28% of its shares are sold short, meaning a sizable percentage of investors are betting it will head lower.

However, with Tesla trading near three-year-lows, I took the opportunity to open up a small position in the stock, in spite of the market's recent concerns around the stock. Here's why.

1. Bankruptcy seems highly unlikely

In the email that's alarmed some Tesla-watchers and delighted bears, Musk said he and CFO Zach Kirkorn will ""examine every expenditure at Tesla, no matter how small"" and emphasized the urgency to cut back on unnecessary expenditures. Taken at face value, the statement may seem like a dire warning, but less than a month earlier, Musk told investors the company would be free cash flow positive for every quarter for the rest of the year, and the company just raised $2.7 billion, effectively giving it $4.9 billion in cash to work with, since it finished the first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet.

What seems missing in Musk's statement is the implicit assumption that the company must be too tight on cash to accomplish all of its goals, which include a ramp-up in production of the Model 3 and Model Y, construction of the Shanghai Gigafactory, development of the Tesla Semi, and other long-term initiatives. If cash burn is faster than expected, one of the non-cash-flow-producing projects will probably have to be delayed, or the company can raise more capital as it just did. It could even shift its business model by selling its battery packs to other carmakers, or licensing its technology, though Musk is clearly reluctant to do that. The idea that Tesla will simply run out of money one day in the next year and shut down its entire business seems a little ridiculous.

Bond markets have responded to the recent news by discounting Tesla's debt further, a sign that doubts are growing about the company's ability to pay it back. Tesla has $1.7 billion in debt maturities over the next year out of about $11.6 billion in total debt, and around $4.9 billion in cash to meet those near-term maturities and run its business. If bond prices stay low, refinancing would likely become more expensive, but Tesla also has the option of selling more stock or convertible debt, which carries a lower interest rate than traditional loans. The convertible debt it just raised carries an interest rate of just 2%.

Equity investors should keep in mind that bonds are largely priced according to risk, and bondholders don't have the upside potential that stockholders do. Considering the stock is down 40% this year, the risk of bankruptcy or taking on more costly debt already seems adequately priced in.

2. The upside potential is still enormous

Even bears have to admit that Tesla has accomplished a number of impressive feats in its history, including building high-performance electric cars at scale, winning numerous awards and customer acclaim, and building a battery business that's significantly ahead of those of its competitors. UBS, for example, estimates that the manufacturing cost of its batteries are about 20% cheaper than the next closest competitor at $111/kWh compared to $148/kWh from LG Chem.

Tesla is a leader in two industries on the cusp of a revolution -- cars and renewable energy. It's clear that the auto market is on the verge of a transformation -- in autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and innovations like ridesharing. That is partly why the market has valued""disruptive"" transportation companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Tesla so highly while punishing legacy carmakers such as Ford and General Motors, though whether that discrepancy is warranted remains to be seen as Ford and GM are also innovating. The global opportunity for Tesla in electric and autonomous vehicles is huge, and the stock could easily soar if it starts to capture more of that opportunity, especially in China, which already buys more than half of the world's electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. The potential for the stock to turn into a multibagger makes the downside risk worth it.

Tesla's vehicles are generally highly rated in driver-assisted technology, and the company recently said that all cars being produced now have the computer and other hardware necessary for full self-driving capabilities, once the software is ready. There's plenty of uncertainty in the future of autonomous vehicles as the technology is still being developed and consumers need to be convinced of its safety, but Intel sees a $7 trillion ""passenger economy"" evolving by 2050, and Tesla's valuation should reflect its potential role in that future.

Similarly, as more of the world transitions to renewable energy, Tesla's batteries, solar panels, and products such as its Powerwall and Powerpack, which also capitalize on Tesla's advanced battery technology, could see exponential growth ahead. Though sales in its energy generation and storage segment fell 21% in its most recent quarter, the company expects a significant increase in energy revenue for the year as it works through a backlog in Powerwalls and commercial storage orders, and expects an increase in retrofit solar deployments in the second half of the year. Last year, energy generation and storage revenue jumped 39% to $1.5 billion.

3. It's still the best brand in cars

While Tesla's ability to break through and become the first new American auto company in generations is impressive, what's equally noteworthy is that the company did it with essentially no traditional marketing. Legacy carmakers flood the airways with ads, but Tesla's brand is strong enough to create a ""pull"" effect, generating consistent buzz and demand that has given the company tremendous brand value. Even if its rivals can match Tesla vehicles' performance, other automakers probably won't be able to reach Tesla's brand power.

AutoTrader just named the company the ""Most Loved Brand"" for 2019, based on a survey of 60,000 car owners, and Tesla owners regularly rave about the cars on social media and elsewhere. Historically, demand for the vehicles has outstripped supply.

Much like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its heyday, Tesla has built a high-end, aspirational brand that's known for inventing the future. Transitioning that kind of brand into the mass market, the company's next step, isn't always easy, but Apple serves as a model here, as the iPhone maker took what was once an edgy ""alternative"" brand and made it into the most valuable one in the world, selling billions of iPhones. Whether Tesla can do the same is yet to be determined, but the playbook is clearly there, and Tesla's brand will give it a crucial advantage as it makes that push.

What's next

At this point, Tesla's foreseeable future seems as if it will end in one of the following scenarios:

It runs out of cash and goes bankrupt.
It continues to struggle to generate sustainable profits, and the stock slides some more.
It reaches, or reasonably approaches, its near-term production goals, survives the current cash crunch, and looks to have a brighter future ahead.

Of those, the last one still looks like the most likely outcome to me, especially as Tesla's brand value is not going to easily erode.

While the stock is clearly risky and Musk can be his own worst enemy at times, the upside potential seems to make the recent sell-off an attractive buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors."
183,0.8743,0.073,0.87,0.057,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) . Shares have lost about 21.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Tesla due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

Tesla Earnings and Revenues Miss Estimates in Q1
Tesla reported loss per share of $2.90 in first-quarter 2019, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of $1.21. The company recorded loss of $3.35 per share in the prior-year quarter.
During the reported quarter, net loss attributable to common shareholders amounted $702.1 million compared with the year-ago net loss of $709.6 million.
Revenues increased to $4.5 billion from $3.4 billion registered in first-quarter 2018. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.8 billion.
During the quarter under review, Tesla’s vehicle production and delivery numbers registered sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively. The company managed to produce around 77,100 vehicles — consisting of 62,950 Model 3, and 14,150 Model S and X. Out of the total delivered figure of 63,000 units, Model 3 accounted for 50,900 while Model S and X were 12,100.
Total automotive revenues, including revenues from automotive sales and leasing, increased 36% year over year to $3.7 billion in the reported quarter.
Energy generation and storage revenues decreased from $410 million in first-quarter 2018 to $324.7 million in the reported quarter. This decline was mainly due to lower solar deployments.
Services and other revenues increased 87.1% year over year to $492.9 million.
Tesla’s first-quarter 2019 automotive gross margin was 20.2%, increasing 43 basis points (bps) from first-quarter 2018.
Energy generation and storage gross margin decreased 606 bps on a year-over-year basis to 2.4%.
Financial Position
Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $2.20 billion as of Mar 31, 2019, compared with $2.67 billion, as of Mar 31, 2018.
Net cash used by operating activities amounted to $639.6 million in first-quarter 2019 compared with $398.4 million of net cash used in first-quarter 2018. Capital expenditure declined to $279.9 million from $655.7 million in the year-ago quarter.
Model 3 Update
The Model 3 production increased 3% in first-quarter 2019 on a sequential basis. This modest improvement in production rate was due to changes in the production process for the launch of new variants of Model 3, fewer working days and supplier limitation.
The company began production and deliveries of Model 3 vehicles for the international markets during first-quarter 2019. In order to quickly meet overseas demand, Europe and China Model 3 builds occurred in the first half of the quarter while US Model 3 builds occurred in the second half.
Outlook
Tesla reiterates 2019 vehicle delivery guidance of 360,000-400,000 vehicles. The company targets to produce 500,000 vehicles globally in 2019.
Again, Energy generation and storage revenues are likely to increase considerably due to the storage business. Further, the Services and Other business is set to grow in 2019 on account of rise in fleet size and used-car volume.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -36.98% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

Currently, Tesla has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Tesla has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months."
184,0.988,0.12,0.839,0.042,"If an email from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk to employees this week is any indication of how vehicle deliveries for the electric-car company may fare this quarter, they'll jump both sequentially and year over year. The news is reassuring, as a growing number of analysts and investors are worried about demand for the vehicles.

Will Tesla report record deliveries?

""Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!"" said Musk in an email to employees Wednesday night, according to the website Electrek.

If Tesla can deliver 91,000 vehicles in its second quarter, this would represent a 44% and 123% sequential and year-over-year increase, respectively. In addition, this would put trailing-12-month vehicle deliveries up nearly 160% year over year.

Notably, management guided for 90,000 to 100,000 deliveries in the company's first-quarter shareholder letter. But there have been concerns that Tesla was overly optimistic about its guidance for the period. Wednesday night's email from Musk suggests Tesla's guidance may be within reach after all.

The record quarter would follow Tesla's worse-than-expected deliveries in Q1. Deliveries during the period suffered from a sharp drop in Model S and X orders following a pull-forward of demand for the two vehicles in Q4 as U.S. customers aimed to take delivery before the U.S. electric vehicle tax credit was cut in half. In addition, troubles with shipping the Model 3 overseas hurt the quarter's delivery tally.

Can Tesla build enough vehicles?

The wording of Musk's email suggests supply is the primary constraint for deliveries during the quarter. To surpass its record-high deliveries achieved in Q4, Tesla needs ""sustained output of 1,000 Model 3's per day,"" Musk said.

He continued: ""Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1,000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we've averaged about 900/day this week, so we're only about 10% away from 7,000/week.""

If Tesla ""rallies hard,"" the company can achieve this, Musk said in the email.

Growth is a key for profitability

Execution on its growth plans is crucial for Tesla since higher deliveries lead to improved economies of scale and -- ultimately -- profitability. The automaker demonstrated this in Q4 when record deliveries helped Tesla achieve positive free cash flow of $910 million and earnings per share of $0.78.

While Tesla isn't expecting to be profitable in its second quarter on a GAAP basis, management did guide for positive free cash flow during the period. To become profitable on a GAAP basis as well, deliveries will need to continue to rise throughout the year. ""As the impact of higher deliveries and cost reduction take full effect, we expect to return to profitability in Q3 and significantly reduce our loss in Q2,"" management said in Tesla's first-quarter shareholder letter."
185,0.9964,0.134,0.84,0.026,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedly offered to buy Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at a price around $240 per share in 2013, said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin on Tuesday. The surprise news comes as the electric-car maker's shares fell below $200 amid growing concerns from analysts covering the stock.

Though the bid was in 2013, recent pressure on Tesla's stock price makes this news particularly interesting. After all, in 2013, Tesla was only delivering just over 22,000 vehicles a year. Trailing-12-month deliveries today, however, are closing in on 300,000. If Apple really did consider buying Tesla at a higher price when sales were much lower, it would make sense for the tech giant to revisit the potential acquisition as the automaker's stock slumps.

Tesla: An acquisition target?

""Around 2013, there was a serious bid from Apple at around $240 a share,"" said Irwin in an interview with CNBC. He continued:

This is something we did multiple checks on. I have complete confidence that this is accurate. Apple bid for Tesla. I don't know if it got to a formal paperwork stage, but I know from multiple different sources that this was very credible.

We may never know whether this rumored offer really happened. But considering that Musk admitted in a 2014 interview with Bloomberg that he met with Apple's head of acquisitions in the spring of 2013, it's quite possible.

At the time, Musk said it was ""very unlikely"" Tesla would be acquired by Apple, explaining: ""We need to stay super focused on ... creating a compelling mass-market electric car. And I'd be very concerned in any kind of acquisition scenario, whoever it is, that'd we become distracted from that task which has always been the driving goal of Tesla.

But Tesla's mass-market car, Model 3, has now arrived. In addition, production has already ramped up to an annualized rate of several hundred thousand units per year.

Why an Apple-Tesla merger could make sense today

If there ever were a good time for Tesla to accept a buyout offer from Apple, today would be it. Shares have been under immense pressure recently, sliding nearly 30% over the past 30 days as investors fret the company's big first-quarter loss and as a growing number of analysts make bearish calls on the stock.

From Apple's view, Tesla could give the tech giant access to a major growth opportunity. Tesla's trailing-12-month vehicle sales are up 158% year over year and management expects total vehicle deliveries in 2019 to be between 360,000 and 400,000, up 45% to 65% year over year.

The big holdup for Apple, of course, could be the capital-intensive nature of Tesla's business that has made sustainable profitability look like a pipe dream to date. But the automaker believes profitability is on the horizon, with management guiding for positive free cash flow for the remaining three quarters of 2019. If Tesla is truly making progress toward this target, the electric-car maker could be a good acquisition target for Apple -- especially now that its stock is trading lower.

On the other hand, Apple is known for its penny-pinching approach to acquisitions and has stayed away from buying companies outside of its core competence. A Tesla acquisition, therefore, is somewhat out of character for the company. But if Apple is already considering a foray into electric vehicles or autonomous-vehicle technology -- and rumors around its "" Project Titan"" suggests it may -- then an Apple-Tesla merger could make sense."
186,0.4215,0.08,0.853,0.068,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continued to slide lower on Wednesday. The stock fell as much as 5.7% but was down 4.5% as of 12:47 p.m. EDT.

Tesla's decline follows yet another bearish take on the stock from an analyst.

So what

On Wednesday, Citi Research analyst Itay Michaeli lowered his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock from $238 to $191 while maintaining a sell rating.

""The risk/reward still appears negatively skewed despite the recent capital raise and stock pullback, mainly on lingering demand/free cash flow concerns,"" said Michaeli (via Barron's). Signs of trouble for the company include Tesla's recent cost-cutting measures and price cuts, the analyst said. In addition, the company's dependence on China for some of its sales growth could be a risk, he argued.

Now what

Though Tesla's combined first-quarter Model S and X deliveries fell both sequentially and year over year and Model 3 deliveries were down sequentially, management maintained an optimistic tone about the rest of the year in its first-quarter update. The company said it expected to be cash flow positive during the current quarter and in the second half of the year while growing full-year deliveries 45% to 65% year over year. However, a growing number of analysts seem to be betting the automaker was overoptimistic."
187,0.9954,0.117,0.86,0.024,"Investors absolutely love speculating about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquiring Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The notion comes up like clockwork every few months, and continues to make little sense, particularly in the recent context of all the headwinds that Tesla is facing around demand challenges, getting hit by President Trump's trade war, and more. One analyst is now claiming that he has it on good record that serious acquisition negotiations took place back in 2013.

There's a decent chance that talks did take place, but that's ancient history in the world of tech.

A ""serious bid from Apple at around $240 a share""

In an appearance on CNBC this morning, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin was discussing a new research note from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull, that slapped a bear-case price target of $10 on Tesla shares. Roth has a neutral rating on Tesla and had lowered its price target to $240 last month. Irwin elaborated on his call:

The reason we weren't more bearish when we rolled coverage back out several months back, is the bid from Apple. Around 2013, there was a serious bid from Apple at around $240 a share. This is something we did multiple checks on. I have complete confidence that this is accurate.

Irwin continued:

Apple bid for Tesla. I don't know if it got to a formal paperwork stage, but I know from multiple different sources that this was very credible. So right now, Apple is building multiple, very large dry rooms in California. What does that mean? They're doing something interesting and exciting on the battery side. Project Titan is absolutely not dead. If Apple had interest then, they would probably have interest now at the right price.

As far as the purported 2013 bid goes, remember that in 2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk did confirm that Tesla had talks with Apple, but declined to elaborate. ""We had conversations with Apple, I can't comment on whether those revolved around any kind of acquisition,"" Musk told Bloomberg Television in early 2014. Musk had met with Apple's then-M&A chief Adrian Perica in early 2013, according to The San Francisco Chronicle.

It's also worth recalling that around that same time, Google (now Alphabet) CEO Larry Page informally agreed to acquire Tesla after shaking on a deal, since Page is close friends with Musk and Tesla was weeks away from bankruptcy, as documented in Ashlee Vance's biography of Musk. That deal ended up falling through because Tesla was able to begin ramping shipments.

Note that in 2013, Tesla had a lot fewer outstanding shares than it does today, approximately 122 million compared to the 174 million it currently has following numerous capital raises in the years since (including a secondary offering earlier this month). Shares had topped out around $195 that year, so a bid of $240 would have represented a decent acquisition premium and translated into an offer of nearly $30 billion.

As far as Irwin's belief that Apple may still be interested, that seems unlikely. Even as Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly said that the tech titan is open to ""acquisitions of any size,"" the company's largest purchase to date is still Beats, which it acquired for $3 billion in 2014."

Earnings season is largely over, but a few stragglers with nonstandard fiscal years are still reporting results, and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was the highest-profile company among today's group. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) got another vote of no confidence from Wall Street analysts, with one set of prognosticators laying out a case in which the stock could see its price plunge all the way to $10 per share.

There's no place like Home Depot

Shares of Home Depot were down a fraction of a percent following the release of the home improvement retailer's fiscal first-quarter financial results. Home Depot said that revenue was higher by 5.7% compared to the year-earlier period, with net income up 4.5%. A reduction in outstanding share counts lifted per-share earnings by about 9%, topping what most investors following the stock had anticipated.

Not everything went well for the home improvement specialist. Home Depot said that comparable sales increased just 2.5%, including a 3% rise for its U.S.-based operations. That's quite a bit weaker than hoped, especially compared to a strong finish to 2018 for the retailer.

CEO Craig Menear explained some of what was behind the tough times while remaining optimistic. ""We were pleased with the underlying performance of the core business,"" Menear said, ""despite unfavorable weather in February and significant deflation in lumber prices compared to a year ago.""

Looking ahead, Home Depot has reason to be upbeat. Favorable conditions in the broader U.S. economy in general and in the housing market in particular should help lift the company's immediate prospects, and ongoing efforts to bolster its business against competition are likely to remain effective indefinitely into the future. That'll play a big role in whether the stock challenges record highs in the weeks and months to come.

Tesla stalls out

Elsewhere, Tesla's stock was down almost 1%, recovering from a drop of as much as 4% earlier in the session. Amid a rising tide of negative publicity, the electric-auto maker had to deal with a slam from stock analysts at Morgan Stanley this morning.

The Wall Street giant's analyst team laid out an argument for why Tesla's shares could plunge another 95% to hit just $10 per share. In essence, the potential problem for Tesla involves whether the Chinese market for electric vehicles will prove as strong for the company as previously thought. With trade tensions remaining high, it's conceivable that the Chinese government could step in to effectively close the market to Tesla vehicles. If that happens, it would mean an estimated $16 billion to $17 billion in lost sales, and that justified a cut in Morgan Stanley's worst-case scenario from $97 per share to $10 per share.

To be fair, that's just the doomsday scenario. Morgan Stanley retained a $230 price target for Tesla, recognizing the significant value that the company's expertise and intellectual property would have for would-be acquirers. Analysts at rival Baird also made negative comments about Tesla, but even after a $60-per-share cut, Baird's price target remains much higher at $340.

Tesla's problems have piled up lately, including production challenges, liquidity concerns, regulatory threats, and CEO-induced distractions that have caused some investors to lose confidence in the stock. Tesla has a lot of promise as a business, but it'll need to address big obstacles to success before it can get moving in the right direction once again."

The stock's decline follows an analyst's decision to lower his price target for Tesla shares.

So what

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated a neutral rating for Tesla stock over the weekend. But he also lowered his 12-month price target for the stock from $275 to $230. This is down significantly from the $440 price target and outperform rating he had for the stock last December.

The analyst is unimpressed by Tesla's recent efforts to build hype for its autonomous taxi service plans and other projects beyond the Model 3, worrying they are taking energy away from the company's most important priorities.

Ives explained, ""With a code red situation at Tesla, Musk & Co. are expanding into insurance, robotaxis, and other sci-fi projects/endeavors when the company instead should be laser focused on shoring up core demand for Model 3 and simplifying its business model and expense structure in our opinion with headwinds abound.""

Now what

Ives' reference to a ""code-red situation"" likely refers to the company's recent decision to raise capital and cut costs following a $702 million first-quarter loss. These moves could be a sign that demand for Tesla's Model 3 is proving to be worse than management expected.

Unfortunately, investors may not know exactly how demand for Model 3 is faring until Tesla reports its second-quarter vehicle deliveries a few days into July."

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell on Friday, declining as much as 6.9%. As of 3 p.m. EDT, the stock was down 6.1%.

The stock's decline follows news on Thursday afternoon that the automaker was rolling out yet another cost-cutting plan in an effort ""to become financially sustainable.""

So what

In an email to employees, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said executives, including the CFO and Musk himself, would be reviewing every payment. The ""hardcore"" cost-cutting program, Musk said, is necessary because the company's first-quarter cash burn rate implies Tesla has just 10 months to break even.

This cost-cutting initiative comes shortly after the electric-car company raised capital to build a better cash cushion after its cash position fell by $1.5 billion sequentially in Q1.

Now what

In Tesla's first-quarter shareholder letter, management said it expected to be free cash flow positive in Q2, but not profitable on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis during the period. ""As the impact of higher deliveries and cost reduction take full effect, we expect to return to profitability in Q3 and significantly reduce our loss in Q2,"" management forecast."
191,-0.7766,0.064,0.857,0.079,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is undergoing another round of cost cuts, electric-vehicle news website Electrek reported Thursday afternoon. In an email to employees, CEO Elon Musk detailed a concerted effort to eliminate all unnecessary costs.

This cost-cutting initiative follows several recent big programs from the company to reduce expenses and cut any avoidable capital expenditures. Amid the Model 3 production ramp-up last year, Tesla moved to 24/7 operations at its factory in Fremont Factory while simultaneously implementing a plan for the company's finance team to review all large expenses. Then, earlier this year, Tesla announced a 7% reduction to its full-time workforce.

The electric-car company's latest cost-cutting initiative comes as Tesla is trying to move closer to becoming sustainably profitable after reporting a big loss in its first quarter.

Getting ""hardcore""

Executives at Tesla, including CFO Zach Kirkhorn and Musk himself, will be reviewing all expenses. It is ""extremely important"" to ""examine every expenditure at Tesla, no matter how small,"" Musk said in the email, which was obtained by Electrek. The company only has ""about 10 months at the Q1 burn rate to achieve breakeven!"" Musk added.

Examples of payments to be examined as part of the program include ""parts, salary, travel expenses, and rent,"" Musk said. He admitted the program is ""hardcore,"" but said it's ""the only way for Tesla to become financially sustainable and succeed in our goal of helping make the world environmentally sustainable.""

Financial troubles

The capital-intensive nature of the automobile business is weighing heavily on Tesla as the company attempts to deliver its most affordable and highest-volume vehicle yet -- the Model 3 -- in more markets.

In Tesla's first quarter of 2019, the company lost $702 million. In addition, negative free cash flow and the repayment of a $920 million bond meant Tesla's cash position fell $1.5 billion sequentially to $2.2 billion. Worse-than-expected total vehicle deliveries as the company's overseas expansion faced more challenges than expected and as Model S and X shipments tanked didn't help.

Helping buffer its financial headwinds, the company raised $2.7 billion in capital through equity and debt earlier this month. But, as of Tesla's first-quarter update in late April, management doesn't expect to be profitable on a GAAP basis until the third quarter of this year. It's no surprise, therefore, that it's focusing intensely on reducing expenses.

Tesla investors should look for the automaker to eventually achieve a level of financial stability, allowing it to avoid such regular cost-cutting initiatives. Programs like this may take management's eye off the bigger picture and delay longer-term plans."
192,0.9945,0.164,0.743,0.094,"Friday morning was volatile for the stock market, which moved between negative and positive territory several times. The sentiment battle between strong U.S. economic prospects and the threat of a prolonged trade conflict with China whipsawed investors from one extreme to the other. As of 11:45 a.m. EDT, bearish investors were in the ascendancy, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) down 5 points to 25,858. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^SPX) gave up 4 points to 2,873, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^COMP) lost 30 points to 7,868.

Two major companies in the U.S. face very different challenges, but each will have to figure out the best way to move forward and preserve its opportunities for long-term growth. For Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), details about a fatal crash and moves to tighten cost controls in order to reduce the size of recent losses are just the latest in the electric-vehicle specialist's long saga of trying to overcome adversity. At the same time, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a key competitor in China making news today, and negative attitudes among Chinese consumers due to trade disputes could well give the up-and-comer an advantage over the Seattle-based coffee giant.

A bumpy road ahead for Tesla

Shares of Tesla fell 4% in the wake of several pieces of bad news for the electric-vehicle maker. The one drawing the most attention from investors involved a report from the National Transportation Safety Board that found that the company's Autopilot driver-assistance system was active when a Tesla Model 3 crashed in Florida, killing its driver.

According to the NTSB report, the vehicle was driving well above the posted speed limit and failed to stop despite having advanced driver assistance features engaged, including automatic emergency braking. As a result, the vehicle collided with a semitractor-trailer truck that was crossing the road in attempting to make a left turn.

Amid the liability concerns that the crash report raised, Tesla is implementing new controls on expenses. CEO Elon Musk and his executive team will review future expenses before they're made as the company seeks to preserve capital as it continues to lose money. With the share price at multiyear lows, Tesla's decision earlier this month to move forward with a secondary offering of stock and convertible notes seems like a smart decision in hindsight. Amid uncertainty on multiple levels, the automaker might well have been better off accepting a dilutive price to get valuable capital it can use to sustain itself in the future.

Starbucks prepares for Luckin

Meanwhile, Starbucks saw its stock climb a fraction of a percent, remaining near all-time highs. Yet it's one of the coffee company's major new competitors that's getting the lion's share of investor attention today, as China's Luckin Coffee (OTC:LKNC.Y) debuted on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Luckin's IPO priced at $17 per share, but it quickly jumped to gains of 40% to 50% once it began trading in the late morning hours. Shareholders are excited about the company's ability to cash in on the immense Chinese consumer market, especially as an improving standard of living opens up status purchases like gourmet coffee to a wider audience.

Many have worried about Luckin's impact on Starbucks and its plans for growth in the world's most populous country. Starbucks still maintains plans to open 500 stores per year between now and 2021, but the pace of Luckin's expansion has been even faster -- and new capital from an initial public offering could help to sustain that pace of growth.

It's highly likely that the Chinese market is big enough to support both Luckin and Starbucks, and it's entirely possible that having both competitors in the same market could lead new customers to try out both in an effort to find their favorite. That could play well for both companies going forward -- and give Starbucks a chance to win the Chinese market on merit, as well as by using its substantial financial resources."

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell on Monday, declining about 6% as of 11:50 a.m. EDT. The stock's decline comes as the overall market pulls back and as Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas warns that more Teslas on the road could negatively impact the company's brand.

So what

The S&P 500 fell about 2.4% as of 11:50 a.m. EDT. Investors were spooked by the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. This overall market decline weighed particularly heavily on growth stocks like Tesla.

In addition, Jonas warned that more Tesla vehicles on the road and more used ones available for sale may make new Tesla sales less compelling.

""Adding more cars to the road is a form of free advertising,"" Jonas said in a research note (via Barron's). But this means ""there may be a simultaneous price to pay in terms of eroding scarcity value.""

Now what

Because demand has often outpaced supply for Tesla in the past, scarcity marketing has previously played a key role in creating buzz. But word-of-mouth marketing as more Teslas are delivered has also helped in the past.

In the company's most recent quarterly update, management seemed confident in the demand for its vehicles, reiterating guidance for total deliveries in 2019 to rise 45% to 65% year over year."
194,0.9973,0.136,0.797,0.067,"When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) released disappointing first-quarter results just over a week ago, most headlines unsurprisingly revolved around the electric automaker's steep sequential drop in deliveries and, consequentially, its far wider than expected quarterly net loss. Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered a light at the end of the tunnel, suggesting deliveries would rebound in short order and reaffirming their full-year target for delivering 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.

But something else Musk confirmed during the subsequent conference call sent shock waves through another industry: Tesla is not only creating its own insurance product, but it also hopes to launch that product by the end of this month.

Musk added that Tesla's insurance ""will be much more compelling than anything else out there."" In particular, Musk says Tesla wants to capitalize on a ""substantial price [and] information arbitrage opportunity"" by leveraging unique customer data collected from its vehicles.

Warren Buffett isn't so sure

Speaking at the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) annual meeting on Saturday, however, Berkshire Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett mused that Tesla's insurance ambitions are likely to fail.

Considering nearly a third of Berkshire's entire business comes from its insurance segment, which notably counts Geico and General Reinsurance among its subsidiaries, Buffett is obviously in a unique position to speak as an authority on the matter.

""It's not an easy business,"" Buffett stated. ""The success of the auto companies getting into the insurance business is probably as likely as the success of the insurance companies getting into the auto business.""

Buffett offered some precedent, even acknowledging Tesla's data-centric approach, stating:

General Motors had a company for a long time called Motors Insurance Company. And various companies have tried it. [...] I worry much more about Progressive. And I would bet against any company in the auto business [getting into insurance] being any kind of an unusual success. The idea of using telematics in terms of studying people -- it is important to have data on how people drive, how hard they brake, how much they swerve, all kinds of things. So I don't doubt the value of the data. But I don't think the auto companies will have any advantage to that. I don't think they'll make money in the insurance business.

Of course, Buffett was speaking off the cuff about a potentially disruptive, competitive solution to providing auto insurance, and with presumably little knowledge of Tesla's specific plans.

But before we accept Buffet's prediction as gospel -- and with all due respect to arguably the greatest investor and CEO of all time -- remember that Buffett is also the first to admit he's not always right.

Why the Oracle of Omaha could be wrong

First, at least in the near term, Tesla's primary goal may not be to ""make money in the insurance business.""

Rather, the greater short-term benefit of a Tesla insurance plan could be realized by streamlining the Tesla ownership experience, and providing additional cost savings to Tesla drivers on top of their now-nonexistent gas bills. Further reducing the barrier to entry into Tesla's world in this way could create a significant network effect that helps meaningfully increase vehicle orders.

Second, some skeptics have already speculated that -- given the lack of specifics provided by Musk during the call -- this could be a repeat of the previous ""funding secured"" Tweet debacle that left Elon Musk in hot water with the SEC last year.

But we already know Tesla isn't going it alone. In fact, Tesla has enlisted the help of specialty insurance company -- and ironically one of the market's most popular so-called ""mini-Berkshire"" stocks -- Markel (NYSE:MKL). In response to an investor question during its quarterly conference call last week, co-CEO Richard Whitt confirmed Markel's State National subsidiary will provide the fronting for Tesla's insurance.

Whitt described State National -- which Markel acquired in 2017 -- a ""company that provides [...] the plumbing to move risk to capital,"" helping clients navigate difficult regulatory barriers, set rates, and essentially bring their novel ideas to fruition.

Whitt elaborated:

Often the people that have these innovative ideas have a hard time navigating the regulatory environment and being able to execute quite honestly on their innovative ideas. That's where State National can come to the table and help them. In the case of the partnership with Tesla, State National is providing just that. They're supporting innovative solutions that Tesla has [created] with risk-taking partners.

In keeping with that fronted model, Whitt noted that State National will not retain any of the resulting insurance business. Rather, he says that business will be ceded to the unnamed risk-taking partners Tesla has actually secured this time.

The bottom line

""And I don't want to say any more than that,"" Whitt concluded, ""because obviously Tesla and the risk-taking partner have many things they probably want to say about the arrangement.""

For now, that means investors will need to hurry up and wait for more color on Tesla's impending insurance product launch. Without that color, it's admittedly difficult to tell whether the product will be a success. But until then, I think it would be a mistake to assume this notoriously disruptive company can't succeed in the insurance world."
195,0.9944,0.148,0.829,0.023,"Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced last week that it would raise as much as $2.7 billion in an offering of debt and equity -- and Tesla CEO Elon Musk notably expressed interest in buying some of the new shares. Now a new SEC filing shows he followed through, loading up on the maximum amount of shares he said he was interested in buying.

The CEO's move to buy shares comes as the stock is trading significantly lower than the last time he did so. This purchase, combined with Musk's decision to hold on to his massive stake through the stock's tumultuous run in recent years, highlights the CEO's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.

102,880 shares

When Tesla first announced an equity and debt offering last week, Musk initially disclosed an interest in buying up to $10 million of Tesla stock. But the CEO updated his stance the next day, saying he was considering purchasing up to $25 million worth of stock.

Musk put his money where his mouth is. An SEC filing published on Tesla's website on Monday revealed he bought 102,880 shares at a price of $243, or $25 million worth.

The CEO is getting shares at a discount compared to the prices he paid for the stock last year. As Barron's points out, Musk bought nearly $45 million worth of Tesla stock on the open market last year, paying an average price of $331.

Buying and holding...forever

While there may be reasons to be critical when it comes to Musk's leadership tactics, his commitment to being a long-term shareholder is not one of them.

Not only does the CEO have a near-20% stake in the company, he also has sold shares only to fulfill tax obligations. And Musk has publicly committed to being the last one to cash out, telling an audience in Germany in late 2013, ""I will be the last one to sell shares.""

Of course, there's no guarantee Musk will keep his public commitment to hold on to his stake. In addition, he will likely continue to occasionally sell shares to fulfill tax obligations or, perhaps, participate in charitable giving. But given his unwavering commitment to remaining a major Tesla shareholder so far, combined with his new $25 million purchase of Tesla stock, it's unlikely Musk has any plans to sell.

Tesla shareholders may have had a rough run over the past year, with shares declining 15% as the S&P 500 index has risen 8%. But they can comfort themselves with the knowledge that Musk's massive stake has similarly taken a hit. Further, with nearly a fifth of the company owned by Musk, you can bet he has a vested interest in trying to create long-term value so that the stock can eventually turn upward."

In first-quarter 2019, the company’s earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues improved.
In first-quarter 2019, Tesla’s vehicle production and delivery numbers witnessed sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively. It managed to produce about 77,100 vehicles. This included 62,950 Model 3, and 14,150 Model S and X. Out of the total delivered figure of 63,000 units, Tesla’s Model 3 accounted for 50,900 while Model S and X were 12,100. During the quarter, this electric automaker struggled with Model 3 deliveries to Europe and China, owing to longer transit time.
In addition to this, some other factors affecting Tesla’s results are high research and development (R&D), and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. In fact, the EV manufacturer is investing heavily in increasing production capacity, the development of Model X and Model 3, the Gigafactory construction, and expansion of sales, services and Supercharger infrastructure.

197,0.9924,0.119,0.821,0.06,"It's hard to argue that Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) foray into solar energy has been anything other than a disaster. In 2015, the year before it was acquired by Tesla, SolarCity installed 870 megawatts (MW) of solar systems, and had its eye on goals of 1 gigawatt and a million customers. By 2018, Tesla had shrunk the solar business to just 326 MW of installations, and there were no signs it was going to turn the business around. The solar roof (seen below) was supposed to spur interest in solar, but appears to be nothing more than a small niche product, at best, and the Gigafactory 2 manufacturing plant that was supposed to lower costs and improve solar panel efficiency is laying off employees and doesn't appear to be hitting its own production targets.

This week, Tesla launched a last-gasp effort to become a big solar power player again. Its plan doesn't entail offering better technology or customer service -- the company is betting that simply lowering prices will drive growth.

Tesla is addressing solar energy's biggest challenge

Selling residential solar systems has always been a challenge for the industry. Few consumers seek out solar, so companies have to use more proactive sales tactics like door-to-door sales, telemarketing, and retail partnerships. These strategies are what drove SolarCity's growth -- back when it was growing -- and are now used successfully by Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) and Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR).

The problem with these high-touch methods is they're expensive, but high sales costs are consistent with industry trends. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Sunrun spent $0.65 per watt on sales and marketing compared to an installation cost of $2.48.

Tesla's answer to this problem will be to move all solar sales online, which will allow it to reduce staff and lower costs. In theory, this will be a great cost-cutting measure that could allow it to shave approximately 20% off the cost of installing a solar system, but the strategy has never been proven. Solar energy systems require a lot of explanation by salespeople, so Tesla is taking a big risk that it won't reach customers with an online-only strategy.

Will standardization matter?

Another change Tesla will make is standardizing the sizes of the solar systems it sells into 4 kilowatt (kW) increments, and only allowing cash and loan sales.

Simplifying the options on system size will allow installers to use more standardized designs and equipment, potentially lowering costs. But it risks alienating potential customers for whom those 4 kW increments would mean choosing between a system that provides more power than they want for their house, or less.

The financing strategy is a big risk as well. Tesla is trying to reduce solar exposure on its balance sheet, but most solar systems are still sold via leases or power purchase agreements. Those options put the financing on the installer, and they are the primary options Sunrun and Vivint Solar use, though they've started offering loans. But loans have not proven to be particularly popular with consumers in the solar market.

Changing the game

Ultimately, the goal of all of these changes is to dramatically Tesla's overall installation costs. If they work, they'll allow it to offer lower prices of $1.75 to $1.99 per watt on its systems, and still turn a profit. The average solar system costs consumers around $3 per watt installed today, so this strategy has the potential to give Tesla a huge price advantage.

What we don't know is if the price is ultimately the driver of solar adoption, or if customers prefer high-touch sales contacts and a solar system more closely customized to their home's needs. Tesla is betting cost is the key, and this gamble is likely the only option it has left. Sales of its solar power systems in Tesla stores haven't gone well, and the Solar Roof made at Gigafactory 2 in New York appears to be a flop at this point. Cutting prices is a bold move by Tesla -- how the consumer market responds will tell us a lot about what customers value in solar today."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders trailed the market as the stock shed 15% compared to a 4% jump in the S&P 500 index, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The decline added to a tough period for investors in the electric automobile giant, with shares down over 20% so far in 2019 compared to double-digit gains in broader market indexes.

So what

Tesla's April slump came as the company announced surprisingly weak first-quarter sales, with demand for key products like the Model S and Model X cooling off. The slowdown contributed to significant losses in the automaker's fiscal first quarter as red ink landed at $522 million.

CEO Elon Musk and his team are predicting a sharp rebound in automobile deliveries such that its longer-term shipment and production targets will all be met. However, many observers of the stock believe that optimistic outcome will be hard to achieve.

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped on Friday, marking two days in a row of meaningful gains for the stock. Shares rose as much as 5.1% today and were up 4.5% as of 1:30 p.m. EDT.

The stock's gain follows news that Tesla increased the amount it was raising in a debt and equity offering -- a move that credit rating agency Moody's supports.

So what

Tesla said Friday morning it was increasing the total amount of capital it was raising in a stock and debt offering to as much as $2.7 billion -- up from a previous target for as much as $2.3 billion. In addition, CEO Elon Musk expressed interest in buying up to $25 million worth of Tesla stock, an increase from a previous plan to buy up to $10 million.

Moody's senior vice president Bruce Clark was pleased with the news, noting in a tweet from the agency's official Twitter account that the offering ""is credit positive and it will boost the company's liquidity profile by taking its cash position to over $4 billion.""

Also helping the stock may be that the company reiterated its guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 deliveries in Q2.

Now what

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla indicated it would use the cash to strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes. But Musk said during a call with investors yesterday that it would also serve as a buffer if a recession occurs.

The fresh capital will build on a cash position of $2.2 billion at the end of Tesla's first quarter.

In addition, CFO Zach Kirkhorn reiterated the electric-car maker's guidance for a big increase in second-quarter deliveries.

The bullish run for the stock over the last two trading days followed a period of poor performance as Wall Street fretted about CEO Elon Musk's active tweeting and the company's declining cash position. A larger capital raise could help Tesla fortify its balance sheet and give it more flexibility -- and a greater cash buffer -- as it spends heavily to accelerate Model 3 production and deliveries.

Raising capital

On Friday, Tesla announced Friday it would raise up to $2.7 billion in its offering, instead of the $2.3 billion it said it would raise on Thursday. This includes a combination of 3.1 million shares, or up to 3.5 million shares when including additional shares available to underwriters. The company was previously selling 2.7 million shares, while offering 15% more to underwriters. In addition, it's also raising $1.6 billion through convertible debt, up from previous plans for $1.35 billion. Revamped plans for even more cash suggest there was significant interest from investors in the offering.

Tesla also said Friday morning that Musk now intends to purchase up to $25 million of Tesla stock, up from plans for $10 million previously. The Street was happy with the news, as shares climbed about 4% as of 11:50 a.m. EDT.

Pitching the stock

In a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the equity raise, Musk and Kirkhorn pitched the stock, drumming up interest in the offering.

During the call, Musk was particularly optimistic about the company's plans for an autonomous driving network, an idea that was discussed in detail at its recent Autonomy Investor Day. The Uber-like driving network, but with self-driving Tesla vehicles, will help the automaker's market capitalization rise from $44 billion today to $500 billion, Musk's forecast.

Kirkhorn also said the company still maintains its outlook for 90,000 to 100,000 deliveries in its second quarter. The midpoint of this guidance range represents a 51% sequential increase in deliveries and a 133% year-over-year increase. Reiterating its outlook more than a month into its second quarter indicates that Tesla is likely making meaningful progress toward its ambitious target for the quarter.

For the full year, it expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles, representing 45% to 65% year-over-year growth."

Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) Rallies on Plan to Raise Capital

Tesla shares have had a rough 2019, down more than 25% so far, even as the auto industry as a whole gained almost 9% and the S&P 500 has added 16%.

Tesla shares rallied 4% by midday Thursday however, after it was announced that the company had filed a shelf registration with the SEC to issue up to $2B in a combination of convertible notes and new equity shares.

The proceeds will be used to complete manufacturing facilities in China and bring the long-awaited Model Y SUV to market.

(The “shelf” offering means that a company gets approval for a new issue without a set timetable and once approval is granted, can issue the referenced securities as needed.)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk had been adamant over the past year about the fact that Tesla would not have to tap the public markets for cash - instead using the revenues from steeply increased Model 3 revenues to fund both operations and capital expenditures.

Musk himself volunteered that he would personally buy up to $10M worth of the newly issued shares, though that’s a proverbial drop in the bucket compared to the $12.5 billion worth of Tesla shares he already owns – about 20% of the company.

The filing included a $1.35B convertible note offering with an interest rate between 1.5% and 2% annually and a conversion strike that’s roughly 30% above the current stock price, as well as $650M in newly issued shares of the company.

An additional option issued to the underwriters to purchase an additional 15% could push the total value of the deal to $2.3B.

The full offering would result in the issue of between 2.7M and 3.1 M additional shares - and possibly up to triple that number if all the convertibles are exercised.

Normally that potential dilution of existing shareholder equity would result in a selloff in the stock, but this is Tesla after all, and instead of selling, investors gobbled up the shares all day, buying into broad markets that trended lower.

It seems that the markets view the move as the beginning of a trend toward more traditional fiscal management at Tesla.

Companies raise money all the time with all sorts of combinations of equity and debt. In general, it’s a fairly straightforward calculation – we need money for operations and/or investments. How much? When? What is the most efficient way to raise it?

It’s supposed to be a boring process that happens mostly in the Finance department, but Musk made not raising money a point of personal pride in a way that unnerved investors, who feared that he might influence otherwise sound financial decision making in support of his own ego.

The new proposed offering - along with the recent culmination of Musk’s disputes with the SEC over his Twitter communications – demonstrates a path toward a more conventional corporate management structure.

Judging by the reaction in Tesla’s share price, that’s a welcome change.

Elon Musk built Tesla into the company it is today based largely on the power of his own ideas, deep convictions and hard work, but as the company transitions from a tech innovator to a major global automaker, the demonstration of a little old-fashioned financial discipline is definitely a positive development.

Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.

202,0.9973,0.128,0.801,0.071,"On April 1, I chose Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) as the Bear of the Day and it was no joke. Earnings estimates had started to soften again and with the company facing big challenges for production, sales, and profitability, all eyes were on Elon Musk battling with the SEC and the stock price struggling to get back above $290.

Here's one paragraph I wrote that captures the beginning of cracks in the dam...

You can see above that in the past 60 days (the key window for the Zacks Rank calculation), the majority of 8 covering analysts for who we have EPS revisions have all lowered their profit estimates to drive the consensus down from $6.42 to $6.14 for the current year. Now that's only a 4.4% drop, so the magnitude wasn't big. But the agreement among analysts definitely was significant.

Even next year's EPS consensus was slashed 33% to $6.80 from $10.13. And there's no better way to visualize this reversal of fortune than with the Zacks proprietary Price & Consensus chart, which plots changes in annual earnings estimates against the stock price...

Wall Street Analyst Reaction

BofA Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy said Tesla's ""uglier than expected"" Q1 operating results were largely due to weaker deliveries, lower pricing, and lighter gross margins. The analyst revised his estimates downward to be relatively consistent with the company's outlook and commentary, but keeps an Underperform rating and $225 price target on the stock.

Murphy also said he sees an earnings/cash inflection in the second half as ""somewhat questionable."" He believes that Elon Musk now ""appears amenable"" to a capital raise, quoting the CEO as having said ""At this point, I do think there is some merit to raising capital."" Murphy does not expect Tesla to turn the corner on free cash flow until after 2020.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas increased his FY19 delivery forecast for Tesla by 4,000 units to 348,000 to account for the recent announcement of significantly refreshed S and X models, but noted this is still below the low end of Tesla's 360K-400K unit guidance. He also notched down his price target on Tesla shares to $230 from $240, maintaining a $185 per share value for the company's core auto business but lowering his view of the value of Tesla's autonomous assets, or its Mobility unit, to $45 from $55 per share.

While the company recently showed off autonomous technology that was ""extremely impressive,"" Jonas thinks full-self-driving technology will undergo a far slower adoption ramp than the company anticipates and he also doesn't believe fully automated cars will be operated in a private-ownership model as Tesla has envisioned.

Finally, writing for TheFly.com on April 25, Jessica de Sa-Mota put together an excellent summary of the view of one big TSLA bull who was giving up...

Long-term bull cuts Tesla rating as profitability will not 'magically return'

Calling himself a ""long-term bull on the Tesla story,"" Wedbush's Ives said he was ""throwing in the white towel"" and downgrading the stock to Neutral from Outperform as the demand story is quickly changing and the company has ""unfortunately not adjusted to an evolving EV landscape."" The analyst told investors that he views this quarter as ""one of the top debacles"" he has ever seen, while ""Musk & Co. -- in an episode out of the Twilight Zone -- act as if demand and profitability will magically return to the Tesla story.""

Ultimately, Ives believes the company's guidance is aggressive and management and the board are not taking aggressive enough cost cutting actions and shutting down future endeavors to preserve capital and give a sustained path to profitability for the Street.

Further, the analyst continues to feel robotaxis, insurance products, and other endeavors are ""distractions from the growing demand woes"" that are not being addressed. At this point ""the writing is on the wall"" that Tesla will likely have to raise $3B-plus of capital in the near-term to sustain its capex and debt needs given its current profitability path, he contended. The analyst lowered his price target on the shares to $275 from $365 to reflect his reduced numbers for the coming years and his loss of confidence in the story.

Energy Innovator, or Debt Hog?

Tesla may still fulfill the lofty visions of its founder and devoted investors as soon as next year. I certainly wouldn't bet too heavily against Musk with TSLA shares at $250. But until we have more visibility about the business, we may do well to take it a quarter at a time.

And since the company and the analysts got this past quarter so wrong, investors should stay cautious. The Zacks Rank gave us the early stages of a warning in March when shares were trading just below $290. It's telling us to remain on the sidelines now.

As I explained in last month's piece...

The battle lines over the future of Tesla are fought daily among traders, institutional investors, and investment bank analysts.

The spectrum of views run from ""the most revolutionary energy company ever"" to an unsustainable dream built on cheap, and soon to be crushing, debt loads.

I'm not here to take a side in this war of words and wealth today, but to share the single metric that has recently made TSLA a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell.

That metric is the momentum of earnings estimate revisions by Wall Street analysts. Every day, Zacks collects the latest changes up or down in analyst profit projections and funnels them into an algorithm that weights the magnitude and agreement of the revisions.

So we not only produce a consensus EPS estimate (that is also weighted by the most accurate analysts and most recent revisions), but we also pit over 4,000 stocks against each other to determine the relative strength and direction of those revisions.

Traders can have any fundamental or technical view they wish about TSLA shares, but they will always do better by adding a consistent and unemotional quantitative metric used by institutional investors around the globe. The ranking of stocks by earnings estimate revisions produces a key relative strength metric -- the Zacks Rank -- that gets you on the right side of short-term EPS momentum, up or down.

Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is asking the public for $2.3 billion after reporting a substantial loss in Q1 further diminishing its cash reserves. They are offering $738.7 million in stock, including underwriter options, as well as $1.35 billion in 5-year convertible bonds (expecting to receive $1.55 billion from auction). This is easing a lot of investors’ concerns about dwindling capital and liquidity. TSLA is up 4.6% today following this announcement.

Performance

As of April 15 th, 28% of Tesla stock was held short. This was before the latest earnings at which point TSLA was trading at $266. I am assuming that when TSLA broke into the $230 range (a price this stock hasn’t seen since early 2017) the short seller started to cover and it leveled the stock out around $240. TSLA is known for its volatility, since October 11 th last year (7 months ago) the stock rallied 50% then broke down 37%. This is an enormous amount of fluctuation for a large-cap automotive company, especially when TSLA’s price trend has inverse to the S&P 500. What I have found is there is nothing driving Tesla stock price except for Tesla (and Elon Musk), it has a mind of its own.

Below you can see the 52-week TSLA (blue) vs. S&P 500 (red) chart. TSLA doesn’t have any correlation at all with the US equity benchmark. What you do notice are the bounces that TSLA continues to have off of a support level in the mid-$200s and a resistance level just north of $350. This stock has been a solid equity to trade over the past 52-weeks if you were able to gauge the troughs.

Outlook

Elon Musk is perpetually over-optimistic about the future of his company, so it is difficult to gage earnings guidance when expectations are typically overstated. Over the past 15 quarters, earnings have only hit or beat estimates 3 times, missing them 80% of the time. Investors are usually unsure of how to react to the latest earnings and are starting to take Elon’s promises with a grain of salt.

Tesla missed estimated earnings by over 60% and missed revenue estimates by more than 20%. This earnings report was still able to decrease the earnings deficit marginally Y/Y but lost a significant amount from the positive earnings Tesla was able to achieve the past two quarters.

Earnings estimates have adjusted down significantly for 2019 from a strong positive $6.24 per share to ($0.94) in just 90 days. Tesla earnings estimates are notoriously misguided. It is almost like Elon Musk likes to see volatility in his stock. TSLA is sitting at a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) because of this downward adjusted guidance but I don’t agree that this is a strong sell.

Tesla and Elon Musk are names that most Millennials believe in with Tesla’s revolutionary electric cars that has taken the automotive industry by storm and Elon Musk’s versatility genius who doesn’t only want to change our world but start a new one on Mars. Millennials will continue to buy this stock on new lows, with uncertainty being a focal point of TSLA, we are willing to make a bet on this company and its avant-garde CEO.

I am thinking about catching this ""falling knife"" on its new lows and continuing to average down if it breaks, knowing that this firm’s revolutionary technology is in demand and the stock is likely to rebound. The Telsa Model 3 remains the best-selling premium car in the US and has continued to gain momentum domestically and abroad.

Risks and Competition

Some risks associated with this stock includes economic downturns that cut consumer spending on discretionary products like vehicles. Increased competition is also a concern, with the Big 3 making moves to create their own electric and autonomous vehicles. Ford (F - Free Report) has a large presence in Silicon Valley and is planning to have 40 electric cars on the market by 2022. Ford will be releasing its first autonomous vehicle in 2021 according to management. General Motors (GM - Free Report) already has the electric Chevy Bolt on the market and is focusing on Cadillac being their EV segment moving forward with an electric car rexpected to be released in late 2021 or 2022. GM’s Buick and Chevrolet will follow Cadillac with their own EVs in the future. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU - Free Report) released its first EV, the Fiat 500e, in 2013 with an 84-mile range. Fiat Chrysler has been losing $10,000 on every Fiat 500e sold. FCAU just invest $4.5 billion in existing Jeeps plants in order to have 10 hybrid plug-ins Jeeps and 4 all-electric Jeeps for consumers by 2022.

Don’t give up on Tesla yet. The powertrain technology behind an electric engine vs. a combustion one is entirely different. It will take years for the Big 3 to achieve what Tesla has and by then Tesla will have gained more and more market share and economies to scale that the Big 3 might not be able to compete with.

This $2.3 billion cash surge might be just the capital they needed to drive this electric car business into sustainable profitability.

204,0.9895,0.111,0.853,0.036,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) shares have had a rough 2019, down more than 25% so far, even as the auto industry as a whole gained almost 9% and the S&P 500 has added 16%.

The proceeds will be used to complete manufacturing facilities in China and bring the long-awaited Model Y SUV to market.

(The “shelf” offering means that a company gets approval for a new issue without a set timetable and once approval is granted, can issue the referenced securities as needed.)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk had been adamant over the past year about the fact that Tesla would not have to tap the public markets for cash - instead using the revenues from steeply increased Model 3 revenues to fund both operations and capital expenditures.

Musk himself volunteered that he would personally buy up to $10M worth of the newly issued shares, though that’s a proverbial drop in the bucket compared to the $12.5 billion worth of Tesla shares he already owns – about 20% of the company.

The filing included a $1.35B convertible note offering with an interest rate between 1.5% and 2% annually and a conversion strike that’s roughly 30% above the current stock price, as well as $650M in newly issued shares of the company.

An additional option issued to the underwriters to purchase an additional 15% could push the total value of the deal to $2.3B.

The full offering would result in the issue of between 2.7M and 3.1 M additional shares - and possibly up to triple that number if all the convertibles are exercised.

Normally that potential dilution of existing shareholder equity would result in a selloff in the stock, but this is Tesla after all, and instead of selling, investors gobbled up the shares all day, buying into broad markets that trended lower.

It seems that the markets view the move as the beginning of a trend toward more traditional fiscal management at Tesla.

Companies raise money all the time with all sorts of combinations of equity and debt. In general, it’s a fairly straightforward calculation – we need money for operations and/or investments. How much? When? What is the most efficient way to raise it?

It’s supposed to be a boring process that happens mostly in the Finance department, but Musk made not raising money a point of personal pride in a way that unnerved investors, who feared that he might influence otherwise sound financial decision making in support of his own ego.

The new proposed offering - along with the recent culmination of Musk’s disputes with the SEC over his Twitter communications – demonstrates a path toward a more conventional corporate management structure.

Judging by the reaction in Tesla’s share price, that’s a welcome change.

Elon Musk built Tesla into the company it is today based largely on the power of his own ideas, deep convictions and hard work, but as the company transitions from a tech innovator to a major global automaker, the demonstration of a little old-fashioned financial discipline is definitely a positive development.

Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped on Thursday, rising as much as 5.6%. As of 12:10 p.m. EDT, however, the stock was up 2.6%.

The stock's gain follows the company's move to raise about $2 billion of capital through a combination of debt and stock.

So what

Tesla announced it is offering convertible senior notes worth $1.35 billion, with an option for underwriters to purchase an additional $200 million. The company is also offering 2,723,198 shares of its common stock, worth $650 million as of market close on April 30. Underwriters will have the option of purchasing up to 15% more shares.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed interest in purchasing $10 million worth of stock in the offering, indicating he believes shares are compelling at this price.

Now what

Tesla's global expansion has been taking a toll on the electric-car maker's finances. In the first quarter, Tesla lost more than $702 million, or $4.10 per share. In addition, Tesla's cash and cash equivalents took a massive hit, falling by $1.5 billion sequentially to $2.2 billion. But this was in part because Tesla paid off a $920 million bond during the quarter.

Fresh capital will give Tesla more flexibility as it works toward its goal to become sustainably profitable.

In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the capital raise, Tesla said it will use the proceeds ""to further strengthen our balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes."""
206,0.997,0.133,0.841,0.026,"Thursday morning brought choppy trading to Wall Street, as market participants tried to parse through the latest decision from the Federal Open Market Committee to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged. An early rebound gave way to greater nervousness about sustained economic expansion. As of 11:30 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down 168 points to 26,262. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^SPX) dropped 14 points to 2,910, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^COMP) fell 27 points to 8,022.

A couple of key news items from the capital markets showed the highs and lows of the current market environment. After having faced pressure recently, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) decided to turn to investors to raise more cash by selling stock and bonds. At the other end of the spectrum, plant-based meat-substitute pioneer Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) said it would make its debut as a public company, pricing its initial public offering and providing another sign of the strong appetite for IPOs right now.

Tesla makes its move

Shares of Tesla rose 2% after the electric-vehicle manufacturer filed disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a combination of securities to investors in order to raise cash. The move came just days after CEO Elon Musk had told shareholders that Tesla might turn to the public markets for more financing.

Specifically, Tesla said in a statement that it would offer $650 million in common stock to investors. In addition, the automaker will offer $1.35 billion in five-year convertible senior notes. In both cases, underwriters will have the right to purchase up to 15% more than initially offered, bringing the total potential capital raised up to the $2.3 billion mark.

Musk will also participate in the offering by buying $10 million in Tesla stock. That won't be enough to prevent his current position in the shares from being diluted, but it will cushion the blow somewhat.

Investors reacted favorably to the move, even though it still leaves some key questions unanswered. As the CEO said following Tesla's release of first-quarter financial results, ""I don't think raising capital should be a substitute for making the company operate more effectively."" How Tesla will improve its operational and financial discipline remains to be seen, but at least the electric-vehicle pioneer won't have to worry about having enough cash available for a while longer.

Beyond Meat heads for the Nasdaq

Shares of Beyond Meat hadn't yet opened for trading as of 11:30 a.m. EDT, but excitement surrounding the meat-substitute manufacturer's initial public offering was palpable. After having set an initial range for its pricing of between $19 and $21 per share, Beyond Meat said earlier this week that it had boosted its IPO price projections to a higher range of $23 to $25 per share. It also increased the number of shares it would sell by 10% to 9.625 million. The final pricing came out at the top end of that range, raising roughly $241 million for the company.

Beyond Meat's mission includes four primary planks: improving human health, lessening climate change, promoting animal welfare, and easing pressure on natural resources. Traditional livestock production creates problems in all four of those areas, and CEO Ethan Brown and his company believe that by using plant-based ingredients that simulate meat favorites like burgers and sausage, Beyond Meat will be a better alternative that conscious consumers can use -- and that conscious-capitalist investors can profit from.

Already, the trend toward plant-based food is building up steam. Burger King recently said that it would start offering beef alternatives using the Impossible Burger product, a competitor to Beyond Meat, and the appetite for the product has already stoked fears of a shortage. In the long run, the key to Beyond Meat's success will be whether it can convince mainstream consumers that its product's advantages are worth making the switch from regular meat -- and many investors are convinced that it will."

Shares of Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) fell as much as 13.7% in trading Tuesday after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced some aggressive actions in solar. At the close of trading, shares were still down 11.2% on the day.

So what

Tesla announced that it will reduce the price of solar systems by up to 38% from the national average to $1.75 to $1.99 per watt. It would accomplish the lower costs by pushing all of its sales online, asking customers to provide information like pictures of the roof that would normally be taken by Tesla staff. Systems would also be standardized in 4-kilowatt increments, which would help lower costs.

The cost savings of moving sales online could be significant. Sunrun said its sales and marketing costs were $0.68 per watt last quarter, over 20% of the $3.17 that a system costs to build.

Notice, too, that Tesla's proposed sale price is lower than Sunrun's costs. It's not certain that Tesla would be able to reach customers who typically haven't been willing to buy solar online, but if it can, it would be terrible for Sunrun's value proposition.

Now what

I'll take a skeptical view of Tesla's latest gambit in solar. There's been no indication the company has been willing or able to implement a winning strategy in solar, and low costs haven't always been a big winner for the industry. Time will tell whether or not Tesla is going to impact Sunrun's margin, but for now, investors seem worried."
208,0.9748,0.089,0.876,0.035,"On its path to becoming sustainably profitable, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) took a big step backward in its first quarter. Free cash flow for the period was negative $920 million, and the company recorded a GAAP loss of $702 million. In addition, the electric-car maker's cash reserves fell by $1.5 billion sequentially.

These financial headwinds, combined with a 31% sequential decrease in vehicle deliveries during the quarter, have raised concerns from investors. During Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Elon Musk addressed two of investors' biggest questions regarding demand and capital.

How's demand faring?

Despite worse-than-expected deliveries in Q1, the CEO maintained an optimistic view on the demand for its vehicles. ""[W]e do see strong demand for vehicles, the -- both S, X and 3,"" Musk said.

Importantly, Musk also said the company is ""getting past the overhang of the tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on Dec. 31."" He is referring to a pull-forward in demand for its vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the first scheduled reduction in the federal electric-vehicle tax credit on Jan. 1, 2019. For Tesla buyers, the credit was slashed from $7,500 to $3,750.

Based on an ""uptick"" in demand for Model S and X after the company updated the vehicles with a new drivetrain that gives them substantially more driving range on a single charge, as well the signs of recovery in demand from the ""tax credit cliff,"" Musk currently believes combined Model S and X demand will return to a 100,000-unit annualized rate. For context, trailing-12-month sales of the two vehicles combined for the period ending March 31 were about 90,000.

Looking ahead at the full year, Tesla expects demand to grow enough to support 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries, representing 45% to 65% year-over-year growth.

Why not raise capital?

When asked why Tesla stayed away from significant capital raises recently, Musk responded:

I don't think raising capital should be substitute for making the Company operate more effectively. So that -- in that sense, I think it's just -- it's important to have strong financial discipline of the Company and just to make sure we don't have extraneous expenses and that we're just being frugal with capital. ... So, I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while.

Musk went on to note there may be reasons to tap into more capital in the future, ""but this is sort of probably about the right timing,"" he explained.

The CEO also importantly noted that he doesn't believe capital has been a constraint on its growth. ""And if I thought there was a final constraint on growth, we would have raised capital before now.""

Reading between the lines, Tesla appears open to raising capital but seems to be prioritizing a goal to become more self-sufficient with its operating cash flow."
209,0.9917,0.13,0.768,0.102,"Last week, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported ugly results for the first quarter of 2019. The electric car pioneer had warned of impending trouble earlier this month, but investors were still caught off guard by the scale of its losses. Tesla's net loss of $4.10 per share -- or $2.90 per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs -- was worse than even the most bearish analysts' estimates. On average, analysts had been expecting a loss of just $0.69 per share.

Not surprisingly, Tesla's terrible Q1 results did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of CEO Elon Musk. Indeed, Musk confidently predicted that Tesla will return to solid profitability in the second half of 2019 and will produce positive free cash flow beginning this quarter.

However, one comment Musk made during the Tesla earnings call should make investors extremely skeptical of these rosy predictions. Let's take a look.

Tesla has a demand problem

A sharp sequential drop in vehicle deliveries was the main cause of Tesla's first-quarter earnings wipeout. Tesla delivered about 63,000 vehicles last quarter, down by 31% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The Model S and Model X performed especially poorly, with 12,100 deliveries combined, down more than 50% compared to the company's typical run rate for 2017 and 2018.

Part of the slowdown was driven by a planned increase in the number of vehicles in transit to customers outside the United States. Logistics problems also pushed some deliveries into the second quarter. That said, weak demand was the primary cause of the big decline in Model S and Model X deliveries.

Model 3 demand has cooled noticeably as well. Many investors had expected the introduction of the $35,000 standard-range Model 3 to create a huge backlog of demand that would take months to fill. Price cuts for higher-end variants should have added to that demand.

Instead, Tesla is currently promising deliveries within two weeks for all versions of the Model 3 across most, if not all, of the United States. That's a huge change from a couple of years ago, when Elon Musk claimed the Model 3 reservations list was growing steadily even as Tesla was ""anti-selling"" the car, with no advertising, no discounts, and no test-drives available.

Musk expects a quick rebound in orders

Tesla's projections that free cash flow and earnings will return to positive territory soon depend on a rebound in deliveries. The company's official full-year guidance calls for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries, including 90,000 to 100,000 in the second quarter. At the midpoint of those ranges, Tesla would have to deliver an average of 111,000 vehicles per quarter in the second half of 2019, 76% ahead of its Q1 delivery rate.

However, it's becoming clear that order activity would need to accelerate dramatically to support that level of growth. During the Q1 earnings call, Musk stated, ""So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X, as well as continued expansion of Model 3 globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year ... commensurate with our production levels."" He reinforced that point later in the call in response to an analyst's question, noting that ""people just generally don't like buying cars in winter.""

It's true that auto sales tend to be seasonally weak during January and February. However, the introduction of the $35,000 Model 3 and price cuts for the rest of Tesla's portfolio should have boosted demand. Furthermore, March and April tend to be stronger months, so Tesla's order activity should have already rebounded to whatever level is sustainable.

Instead, Musk's comments on the earnings call indicate that he is counting on order activity to continue accelerating throughout 2019. That should be very worrisome for investors, because it means Tesla's forecast for the rest of the year is likely built on unrealistic assumptions.

When it comes to Tesla, skepticism pays

Experience shows that Musk's apparent confidence that demand will accelerate throughout 2019 doesn't mean much. For example, Musk stated on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call that he was "" optimistic about being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward."" Instead, Tesla lost more than $700 million last quarter and expects to report another loss in Q2.

In fact, there are good reasons to doubt that demand will recover, particularly in the U.S., which has historically accounted for the bulk of Tesla's sales. First, Tesla has already exhausted the pool of pent-up domestic Model 3 demand. Second, the federal electric vehicle tax credit for Tesla purchases is set to fall by 50% ($1,875) on July 1, raising the effective price of a Tesla in the second half of 2019. Third, many potential buyers may choose to wait for the Model Y crossover that was unveiled last month. Crossovers are far more popular than sedans today.

Musk is trying increasingly outlandish tricks to pump up demand for Tesla vehicles, such as his recent claim that Tesla owners will be able to make up to $30,000 annually by renting out their vehicles through a robotaxi network as soon as next year. (Most experts agree that a wide rollout of robotaxis will take years or even decades to achieve.) That may persuade some consumers to buy a Tesla, but it isn't likely to be a long-term game changer.

To be sure, there are plenty of interesting projects under way at Tesla. However, if history is a guide, they could all take longer than expected to execute. Meanwhile, demand is cooling for Tesla's existing vehicles, which may lead to a big shortfall in deliveries in 2019 and 2020. That could further stress Tesla's weak balance sheet and drive its share price even lower."
210,0.9839,0.134,0.785,0.081,"Finally, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are in agreement. The news comes shortly after Musk and the SEC filed for an extension on a judge's order to settle on matters related to the CEO's tweets about company information.

Following a week in which shares slid sharply after disappointing first-quarter results, a settlement is likely a breath of fresh air for investors. The news has shares up nearly 1 percent in after-hours trading on Friday as of 6:58 p.m. EDT, likely because the settlement involves no punishment for Musk or Tesla.

A long battle

This settlement is part of a long battle between the SEC and Musk, all dating back to Musk's tweet last summer about possibly taking the company private. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" said the CEO in an Aug. 7, 2018 tweet.

The SEC filed a complaint about the tweet in September, an action that eventually led to a settlement including restrictions to Musk's Twitter usage, $20 million in fines charged to both Musk and Tesla, and the removal of Musk from Tesla's chairman position. But the SEC alleged earlier this year that Musk broke his agreement with the SEC about how he tweets, and the securities organization sued Musk, asking a judge to hold the CEO in contempt. When the SEC and Musk went to court, the judge ordered the parties to ""take a deep breath, put on your reasonableness pants"" and settle.

Given a week to settle the matter, the two parties asked for two extensions but have now come to an agreement that includes no punishment, but features more specific restrictions and oversight over the CEO's tweets. Per this new settlement, some of the types of items Musk has agreed not to discuss include ""potential or proposed mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, tender offers, or joint ventures,"" new or potential business lines, events requiring an 8-K filing, and more.

Time to execute

With this settlement in the rearview mirror, shareholders are likely hoping Tesla will focus primarily on execution.

Some of the stock's poor performance over the past year is likely because of the CEO's behavior. Shares are down 16% over the past 12 months despite significant sales growth, two quarters of profitability, and a narrower loss in the company's most recent quarter compared to the year-ago period. But with an SEC settlement behind it, Tesla now has an opportunity to improve the narrative toward its stock.

If the company can continue growing sales and become free cash flow positive while avoiding high-profile litigation, Tesla may be able to reinvigorate investor confidence. The electric-car maker has some bold aspirations for 2019, including positive free cash flow in the three remaining quarters, 43% to 59% sequential growth in vehicle deliveries in Q2, and 45% to 65% year-over-year growth in total 2019 deliveries.

Now Musk and Tesla just need to execute."
211,0.6059,0.091,0.825,0.084,"Friday was another relatively quiet day for the stock market, with major benchmarks finishing the week at or near record levels. Favorable readings on the U.S. economy helped buoy investor sentiment, and positive earnings results from several corners of the market reinforced the idea that stocks can generally hold onto their huge advances since mid-December. Yet some companies had bad news that caused them to lose ground. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Briggs & Stratton (NYSE:BGG), and Target (NYSE:TGT) were among the worst performers. Here's why they did so poorly.

Tesla keeps slowing down

Shares of Tesla dropped another 5%, adding to losses from earlier in the week as investors digested the shift in sentiment among analysts following the stock. One particularly bullish analyst changed gears abruptly yesterday, with Wedbush cutting its rating from outperform to neutral on an assessment that CEO Elon Musk's outlook is overly aggressive without taking necessary steps to cut costs. Today, investors seemed nervous that the share-price decline itself could prompt problems, as it's increasingly apparent that Tesla will have to raise capital at some point. If it resorts to selling stock at depressed levels, Tesla could face even greater losses ahead.

Briggs & Stratton gets clipped

Briggs & Stratton saw its stock fall 14% after the lawn, garden, and power equipment specialist reported its fiscal third-quarter financial results. Sales were down 4% from the year-ago period, with the company blaming bad weather, as well as the impact of the Sears bankruptcy on revenue. Moreover, Briggs cut its earnings guidance for the full fiscal year by more than half, citing efforts to launch new initiatives to optimize its business and ongoing weak demand. CEO Todd Teske is hopeful that Briggs & Stratton is in a good position to mount a recovery from current levels, but until Mother Nature cooperates, it could remain tough going for the company.

Target deals with a new Amazon threat

Finally, shares of Target lost nearly 6%. The department store retailer's stock reacted negatively to news from e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) that it would begin to offer one-day shipping to customers as part of Amazon Prime. The move raised questions about whether Target and its peers will try to match Amazon, despite having already made substantial investments toward trying to keep up with the e-commerce company in the past. The good news for Target is that Amazon admitted that it could take it some time to work up to achieving its one-day goal, giving the department store leader a chance to consider its future strategy more fully."
212,-0.5106,0.078,0.84,0.082,"What happened

It was a rough Thursday for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), when its shares were hit in the aftermath of the electric-car maker's bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss. On Friday, shares were down sharply for a second day in a row. They fell as much as 6.4% but are down 5.3% as of 2:50 p.m. EDT.

The stock's decline on Friday comes as Citron Research, a short-seller that reversed its position on the stock late last year and went long, is now saying it's no longer long or short on the stock.

Investors may also still be reacting to the company's first-quarter earnings report.

So what

""I do not believe the company is insolvent although I do believe they need to raise money,"" said Citron Research founder Andrew left in a statement to Reuters Thursday night. Further, ""Left is disappointed with the way the company is communicating with shareholders,"" Reuters wrote. Left's shift away from a bullish call on the stock follows Tesla's first-quarter results, which featured a non- GAAP loss per share of $2.90 and a $1.5 billion sequential decrease in the company's cash and cash equivalents.

In addition, Tesla CEO Elon Musk's battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dragging on, as the two parties requested a second extension to settle a dispute about how Musk uses Twitter to communicate information about Tesla.

Now what

Despite reporting worse-than-expected first-quarter deliveries and a significant quarterly loss, Tesla remains optimistic about the rest of the year. Not only does Tesla expect second-quarter deliveries to increase about 50% sequentially and more than double on a year-over-year basis, but management expects to narrow its loss in Q2 and return to profitability in Q3."
213,0.9929,0.112,0.848,0.039,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) reported loss per share of $2.90 in first-quarter 2019, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of $1.21. The company recorded loss of $3.35 per share in the prior-year quarter.
During the reported quarter, net loss attributable to common shareholders amounted $702.1 million compared with the year-ago net loss of $709.6 million.
Revenues increased to $4.5 billion from $3.4 billion registered in first-quarter 2018. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.8 billion.
During the quarter under review, Tesla’s vehicle production and delivery numbers registered sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively. The company managed to produce around 77,100 vehicles — consisting of 62,950 Model 3, and 14,150 Model S and X. Out of the total delivered figure of 63,000 units, Model 3 accounted for 50,900 while Model S and X were 12,100.
Energy generation and storage revenues decreased from $410 million in first-quarter 2018 to $324.7 million in the reported quarter. This decline was mainly due to lower solar deployments.
Services and other revenues increased 87.1% year over year to $492.9 million.
Tesla’s first-quarter 2019 automotive gross margin was 20.2%, increasing 43 basis points (bps) from first-quarter 2018.
Energy generation and storage gross margin decreased 606 bps on a year-over-year basis to 2.4%.

Financial Position
Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $2.20 billion as of Mar 31, 2019, compared with $2.67 billion, as of Mar 31, 2018.
Net cash used by operating activities amounted to $639.6 million in first-quarter 2019 compared with $398.4 million of net cash used in first-quarter 2018. Capital expenditure declined to $279.9 million from $655.7 million in the year-ago quarter.
Model 3 Update
The Model 3 production increased 3% in first-quarter 2019 on a sequential basis. This modest improvement in production rate was due to changes in the production process for the launch of new variants of Model 3, fewer working days and supplier limitation.
The company began production and deliveries of Model 3 vehicles for the international markets during first-quarter 2019. In order to quickly meet overseas demand, Europe and China Model 3 builds occurred in the first half of the quarter while US Model 3 builds occurred in the second half.
Outlook
Tesla reiterates 2019 vehicle delivery guidance of 360,000-400,000 vehicles. The company targets to produce 500,000 vehicles globally in 2019.
Again, Energy generation and storage revenues are likely to increase considerably due to the storage business. Further, the Services and Other business is set to grow in 2019 on account of rise in fleet size and used-car volume.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

214,0.9046,0.078,0.883,0.039,"Lower-than-expected first-quarter vehicle deliveries announced earlier this month sparked concerns about Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) ability to continue ramping up production and meet a year-end target for total deliveries to increase 45% to 65% year over year. But Tesla management shrugged off these concerns in its first-quarter update, reiterating its ambitious guidance.

Here's a closer look at what else Tesla revealed in its first-quarter update, including negative free cash flow, a higher take rate for Autopilot options, and management's expectations for profitability throughout the rest of the year.

Tesla's first-quarter results: The raw numbers

Data source: Tesla 2019 first-quarter shareholder letter.

As Tesla revealed earlier this month, vehicle deliveries increased 110% year over year. This was fueled by a surge in Model 3 deliveries, which increased from 8,182 deliveries in the first quarter of 2018 to 50,928 units in the first quarter of 2019. Combined Model S and X deliveries, however, fell 45% year over year.

Higher overall deliveries helped revenue climb 33% year over year. But $188 million worth of non-recurring items that negatively affected Tesla's profitability, lower Model S and X deliveries, and about 11,000 vehicles in transit to customers at the end of the quarter weighed on profitability. The company's net loss for the period was $702 million, or $4.10 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Tesla lost $2.90 per share.

What management had to say

In its fourth-quarter shareholder letter, Tesla said lower Model S and X deliveries were mainly due to ""to seasonality, pull-forward of sales into Q4 2018 in the U.S. due to the first scheduled reduction of the federal EV [electric vehicle] tax credit in Q1, and discontinuation of our 75 kWh battery pack.""

Tesla remains pleased with Model 3 deliveries, noting the vehicle was ""yet again the best-selling premium car in the US in Q1, outselling the runner-up by almost 60%.""

Highlights

Free cash flow was negative $920 million, a slight improvement from negative free cash flow of $1.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Tesla's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.5 billion sequentially to $2.2 billion, primarily because of a $920 million bond payment and a higher number of vehicles in transit to customers at the end of the quarter.
The automaker's aggressive rollout of Autopilot features recently is resulting in a higher percentage of customers who are paying for Autopilot options.
Tesla's automotive gross margin was 20.2%, down from 24.3% in the year-ago quarter.

Looking ahead

Thanks to recently announced improvements to Model S and X and continued global expansion of its Model 3, Tesla expects its ""order rate to continue to increase throughout the year as our production levels increase."" Management guided for 90,000 to 100,000 deliveries in Q2 and maintained its guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 total deliveries during the full year, up from about 246,000 in 2018.

Tesla also expects to be cash flow positive for the three remaining quarters and return to GAAP profitability in Q3. For Q2, management guided for another quarterly loss but said it will be significantly narrower than in Q1."
215,0.9961,0.095,0.873,0.031,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk threw tons of shade this week at Waymo, Alphabet 's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) self-driving car unit. The issue he raises could make all the difference in the race to autonomous vehicle supremacy.

Speaking at the Tesla's recent Autonomy Day event, Musk called Waymo's lidar technology ""friggin' stupid"" and ""a crutch."" Lidar sensors are used by virtually every company attempting to build an autonomous car today except Tesla. Should Musk be proven right on this issue, Tesla would have a material advantage over its rivals in the coming age of driverless vehicles.

That would be hugely consequential for not only Tesla investors, but also shareholders in Alphabet, NVIDIA, and other companies that are looking toward autonomous driving as a catalyst for future growth.

With that in mind, let's dissect how lidar works, how Tesla's approach is different, and which side may come out the winner in this debate.

Lidar explained

Lidar, an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging, illuminates its surroundings with pulsed lasers, then uses sensors that can detect the pulse reflections to map objects up to about 200 meters away. If you've seen a self-driving car near you -- likely in California or Arizona -- and you've noticed the large hardware stack on the vehicle's roof, that's the lidar sensor array.

While lidar takes care of most of the heavy lifting for Waymo, all autonomous vehicle prototypes today use a combination of sensors to map objects around them. That's because lidar has some detection issues. These include:

Lidar doesn't work as well in rainy or dusty environments, as particles can interfere with the light wavelengths it monitors (though it supposedly works better than current cameras in low light conditions).
A lidar system is not as strong when it comes to detecting objects that are very close.
Lidar can't distinguish between colors.
Lidar sensors consume a lot of power.

Finally, lidar has traditionally been very expensive -- the sensors required to outfit just one vehicle cost upwards of $75,000. However, Waymo says its team has cut the cost of its proprietary sensors down by 90% to only about $7,500. Waymo recently announced it will be selling its proprietary lidar sensors to select partners in the fields of robotics, security, and agricultural technology -- though not to its self-driving competitors.

How Tesla's autonomous system is different

In contrast, Tesla's autonomous driving system depends on a combination of radar, ultrasonic, and passive visual sensors (cameras) to map its surroundings. Of the three, Tesla most emphasizes its next-gen cameras, which work in combination with its own neural network. That neural network is powered by Tesla's proprietary computer chip, which was also unveiled at the Autonomy Day event.

Musk and Senior Director of Artificial Intelligence Andrej Karparthy both said that, with the power of AI and massive data sets, cameras can be trained to work better than lidar sensors. Karparthy made the point that lidar would have trouble distinguishing between a plastic bag and a rubber tire at a similar distance. On the other hand, cameras, combined with a supercomputer accessing a massive data set, can train Tesla's autonomous vehicle system to distinguish between types of objects.

Training a computer to do this task accurately takes a lot of work, but that's where Musk claims Tesla has another advantage. All recently sold Teslas are constantly collecting visual data when they are on the road. Musk said, ""Whether autopilot is on or off, the network is being trained. Every mile that's driven for the car that's (equipped with) hardware 2 or above is training the network.""

Them's fighting words

Curiously, Alphabet itself does a lot of work on this type of visual AI within Google. That leads one to wonder why Waymo is so focused on lidar technology over camera-based sensors if Musk's claims about the latter's superiority were true. It's possible that since Waymo doesn't have as many cars on the road as Tesla, it isn't collecting as much data with which to train its neural engine. However, Waymo's self-driving vehicles have racked up more miles on the road than any of its pure self-driving peers, and many more in simulation. If cameras and AI were the way to go, one would think Waymo would have recognized that and switched over to the superior, but tougher, technology. After all, Alphabet isn't shy about taking its time with its ""Other Bets."" Still, Musk asserts that lidar is a ""crutch.""

Musk made a number of other bold statements on Autonomy Day, including an assertion that Tesla will have a million robotaxis on the road sometime in 2020. That's right -- Musk basically said that Tesla will become an autonomous-vehicle Uber within a year and a half.

Given the regulatory hurdles around self-driving and the other factors involved in scaling up a ride-hailing business, let's just say I'm skeptical that his prediction is totally accurate. In fact, most analysts that attended the event were pretty skeptical about the whole presentation, especially that part.

Nevertheless, if Musk proves right about which autonomous vehicle vision technology is the best, Tesla is poised to be a huge winner, since it's following a technological path that no other autonomous vehicle company is on."
216,0.9928,0.089,0.891,0.02,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) hosted its Autonomy Investor Day earlier this week. There, CEO Elon Musk announced new technology that's being built into the electric-car company's vehicles to enable fully autonomous driving by next year.

Musk and other leaders of his tech team spoke about the company's new self-driving computer, complete with a Tesla-designed processor. Musk said that the new tech would allow Tesla vehicles to be fully self-driving -- with no need for human input -- by 2020. He also gave more details about a Tesla robo-taxi service that would allow owners to add their vehicles to a fleet of self-driving Teslas.

But announcing all of Tesla's cool new tech wasn't enough. Musk also took the opportunity to take a few swings at Tesla's former chip supplier, and a leader in autonomous-driving technology: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).

What Musk said

Musk and his team said the company's new autonomous-vehicle computer would be powered by CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit) chips that will work with eight cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors to enable full autonomy. The Tesla team explained that the new self-driving, dual-chip computer would deliver 144 TOPS (trillion operations per second) processing, and compared it to NVIDIA's self-driving system, which was developed with only one chip.

""At first it seems improbable. How could it be that Tesla, who has never designed a chip before, would design the best chip in the world?"" Musk asked. ""But that is objectively what has occurred. Not best by a small margin -- best by a huge margin. It's in the cars right now."" Tesla's CEO said that the development allowed his company to drop NVIDIA's system last month.

How NVIDIA reacted

The onstage comparison made by Tesla's sometimes controversial CEO didn't sit well with NVIDIA. Representatives for the chipmaker wrote in a blog post the next day that there were ""a few inaccuracies"" at Tesla's event that they needed to correct.

First, NVIDIA said, ""It's not useful to compare the performance of Tesla's two-chip Full Self Driving computer against NVIDIA's single-chip driver assistance system.""

NVIDIA's reps said that Tesla's two-chip computer (with 144 TOPS) should be compared to its DRIVE AGX Pegasus computer, which runs at 320 TOPS -- far greater computing power than Tesla's computer.

Additionally, NVIDIA took issue with Tesla saying that one of its chips, Xavier, only delivers 21 TOPS when it actually delivers 30. The chipmaker also clarified that its Xavier chip was never intended to power fully self-driving vehicles, but was instead designed to manage driver-assistance features.

NVIDIA admitted in its post that ""Tesla is raising the bar for all other carmakers."" But it also stressed that its technology is the only ""open platform that's available for the industry to build on.""

NVIDIA thinks Tesla is moving in the right direction with autonomous vehicles. But it also believes itself to be the only chipmaker that will be a true catalyst to help automakers create self-driving cars.

Why the Tesla and NVIDIA exchange matters

Musk is trying to make the case that Tesla vehicles have some of the most-advanced internally-created technology, and that they will soon be fully autonomous. Concurrently, NVIDIA says its alternative system is powerful enough to be the backbone for an autonomous-vehicle platform that it hopes will eventually be used by the majority of automotive makers. Both assertions can technically be true.

The two companies wouldn't usually need to name each other specifically while promoting their own technologies. But now that Tesla has dropped NVIDIA's chips, each company is trying to prove that it has the superior system.

While Musk made bold predictions about bringing fully self-driving vehicles to roads by next year, NVIDIA has been building computers to run semi-autonomous vehicles for years, and its technology is already proven. Automakers including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo Cars are already using and testing versions of NVIDIA's semi-autonomous systems.

It's too early to tell whether Musk's predictions about his company's autonomous-vehicle future will come true. But in an industry where collaboration on technology is foundational to furthering innovation, taking swipes at a former chip supplier may not be the wisest strategy."
217,0.955,0.095,0.859,0.046,"Just a few years ago, there was a debate about which fueling technology would win long term: all-electric vehicles or hydrogen-powered vehicles. That debate appears to be over.

The final holdouts were Japanese automakers Toyota (NYSE:TM), Hyundai (OTC:HYML.F), and Honda (NYSE:HMC), who make three fuel-cell vehicles that they thought would eventually upend all-electric vehicles. But they've gained very little traction, and now they all seem to be giving in to the reality that EVs have won.

Giving up on a dream

No one investing in fuel cells has officially given up on the technology because there are applications for it even if it's not for passenger vehicles. But there are plenty of signs that automakers are moving on to more fully electric options.

Toyota's push will start with hybrids, where it pioneered partially electric driving with the Prius. It recently announced a Highlander Hybrid that could get a combined 34 miles per gallon to add to Prius, Rav4 Hybrid, Camry Hybrid, and others. Toyota isn't going all electric yet, but it's getting close with a growing hybrid lineup.

Honda has announced an all-electric platform that is aimed at urban drivers. It's expected to launch in 2020 with modest production goals of about 5,000 units the first year. That's small for Honda but a step toward EVs that may make the Clarity fuel cell obsolete.

Hyundai may have made the biggest leap from fuel cells to EVs with the 124-mile-range Ioniq Electric and the 258-mile-range Kona Electric. The company could be a major player in EVs over the long term, with a long range and compelling price points starting below $40,000.

EVs have reached scale

According to InsideEVs, 2.02 million electric or hybrid electric vehicles were sold worldwide in 2018, with 361,307 units being sold in the U.S. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the biggest name in EVs today, with three of the top four best-selling vehicles in 2018, but Toyota, Honda, and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are starting to reach scale in the tens of thousands of units as well.

This compares to 2,300 fuel-cell vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2018, according to InsideEVs. Scale is critical in any manufacturing business, and EVs have a huge scale advantage over hydrogen today.

Hydrogen has a place

None of this is to say that hydrogen doesn't have a place somewhere in the market. Buses, local delivery trucks, and long-haul vehicles will see value in hydrogen's quick fueling and longer range than electric options. Material handling applications also appear to be gaining traction in factories and warehouses.

What's tough to dispute is that the hydrogen fuel cell dream is all but dead for the passenger vehicle market. EVs have improved by leaps and bounds, increasing range and lowering charge time so that there's very little disruption to the average consumer's travel. Now all that's left is for the former hydrogen-focused manufacturers to play catch-up with Tesla, GM, and others, which may be easier said than done."
218,0.9628,0.075,0.885,0.04,"Electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report its first-quarter financial results on Wednesday, April 24. The earnings release follows an update on vehicle deliveries earlier this month, which revealed worse-than-expected numbers. So investors will be looking to see how the sequential decline in deliveries affected the automaker's financials.

Here are three key metrics investors may want to keep in mind when Tesla reports its first-quarter results.

1. Cash

Tesla's two most recent quarters highlighted impressive cash flow, helping the company's total cash and cash equivalents climb by $1.5 billion during the second half of 2018 to $3.7 billion. This was aided by a total of $1.8 billion in free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) during the second half of the year.

But this cash position likely declined sharply in recent months. Not only were first-quarter deliveries worse than expected, but Tesla had also already said it expected a loss in Q1. In addition, Tesla paid off a $920 million bond during Q1.

If its cash position decreases too much, the company may need to raise more capital.

2. Orders

There are serious concerns about the demand for Tesla's vehicles. Sure, its first-quarter vehicle deliveries were up 110% year over year, fueled by the production ramp-up of its newest and most affordable vehicle yet, the Model 3. But Model S and X deliveries fell sharply, declining 45% year over year and 56% sequentially.

In addition, Model 3 deliveries were lower in the first quarter of 2019 than in the fourth quarter of 2018, falling 20% sequentially. While this was primarily because the company ended its first quarter with far more vehicles in transit to customers than it had in the prior quarter, it's a trend worth watching.

To gauge demand, look for commentary from management on order rates of its vehicles. Are quarterly orders above Tesla's current production and delivery levels? Was the volume of orders on the rise, flat, or declining in recent months?

Profitability guidance

Investors should also look to see if Tesla maintains its guidance for positive net income and free cash flow in every quarter beyond Q1. If a quarterly loss persists beyond Q1, the automaker will likely need to raise capital.

In addition, investors should watch Tesla's guidance for full-year deliveries. Will management maintain its full-year outlook for vehicle deliveries between 360,000 and 400,000? With approximately 63,000 vehicles delivered in Q1, quarterly deliveries will need to pick up speed to hit this target range. Furthermore, achieving this volume of deliveries in 2019 is likely necessary for Tesla to make meaningful progress on becoming sustainably profitable.

Tesla will report its first-quarter results after market close on Wednesday, April 24."
219,0.9984,0.129,0.841,0.03,"Once thought to be the stuff of science fiction, driverless-car technology is quickly entering the mainstream. But with dozens of publicly traded companies dipping their toes in the self-driving technology pool, it's difficult for investors to identify the best ways to capitalize on the trend.

So we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to each discuss a driverless car stock they think you should be watching this month. Read on to learn why they chose Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Aptiv (NYSE:APTV).

Slow and steady wins this race

Steve Symington (Alphabet): Every investor knows Alphabet primarily as the parent company of Google, and rightly so. With eight products that each have at least a billion monthly active users -- from Google Search to Gmail, Maps, Google Drive, the Play store, YouTube, Android and Chrome -- the tech giant's enviable suite of web services currently generates the vast majority of its revenue and all operating income every quarter.

But when Alphabet releases first-quarter 2019 results next week, investors should also remember those businesses help fund investments in its ""other bets"" segment, which houses a number of early stage (often pre-revenue) companies that could offer massive sources of incremental growth down the road. One of those other bets is Waymo, Alpahbet's drivers vehicle subsidiary.

During last quarter's conference call in early February, management lauded the December 2018 launch of Waymo One, which enables users to use an app to hail and pay for rides, as well as Waymo's recent expansion, both from a user and geographic standpoint, in the Phoenix area. Alphabet added that it's ""having conversations"" to bring Waymo to ""a number of other interested cities,"" while exploring the application of its driverless-vehicle technology to the logistics and delivery markets.

But CFO Ruth Porat cautioned, ""[W]e are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience -- and that's why we're expanding methodically.""

Alphabet investors should listen closely next week, then, for any updates on Waymo's progress to those ends.

Nobody collects more self-driving data than Tesla

Anders Bylund (Tesla): It's hard to match the amount of real-world experience Tesla has amassed in the field of self-driving cars. The current fleet of Tesla cars may operate at a relatively simple level 2 out of 6, representing partial automation that still requires a human driver, but the company has a lot of wheels on the ground. Tesla had delivered more than 300,000 cars in total at the end of 2017 and proceeded to double that car count over the last five quarters. Each and every one of these vehicles is collecting actual driving data to help Tesla's engineers build better self-driving platforms for the future.

Here's how Tesla co-founder Elon Musk described this business advantage in January's first-quarter earnings call:

""The amount of training that we have -- if you add everyone else up combined, they're probably 5%, I'm being generous, of the miles that Tesla has. And this difference is increasing,"" Musk said. ""[Eighteen] months from now, we'll probably have 1 million vehicles on the road [where], every time the customers drive the car, they're training the systems to be better. I'm just not sure how anyone competes with that.""

Neither am I. In the race to complete automation of the driving experience, Tesla sits on an absolute treasure trove of driving data. Other companies may end up building better electric cars in the end, but those rivals may be forced to pay Tesla for a license to operate their wonderful machines with the best software packages on the planet.

In the meantime, investors are worrying about Tesla's car sales in the short term and the stock price has fallen 18% on a year-to-date basis. The self-driving expertise alone makes Tesla an interesting long-term investment at these prices, and there's much more to the story when you include energy research and actual car sales. You should ignore the short-term bumps in the road and focus on Tesla's fantastic long-term value.

One of the only driverless-car pure plays

Chris Neiger (Aptiv): Sure, there are plenty of companies betting on driverless cars, but perhaps none as much as Aptiv. With its array of sensors and software, the company is one of the only pure plays in the autonomous-vehicle market.

The company was spun off from the automotive supplier Delphi Automotive two years ago and has since been pursuing new technologies and partnerships to make driverless cars a reality. Imagine all of the specialty tech that goes into a vehicle's advanced driver assist systems -- like automatic braking and collision avoidance features -- and Aptiv's building the systems that allow them to work.

One of its most prominent partnerships is with ride-sharing company Lyft. The two companies have taken passengers on nearly 30,000 rides around Las Vegas in self-driving cars and have created one of the largest public commercial self-driving networks in the United States. Aptiv is also working with BMW, Intel, and Mobileye to create a fully self-driving car for the public by 2021.

Aptiv also makes other technologies, like over-the-air-updates, that allow today's vehicles to update their software -- and will enable the vehicles of tomorrow to become smarter and more capable than ever before.

Aptiv's revenue jumped 8% in the most recent quarter, and its earnings per share increased by 5%, to $1.34. That may seem like modest growth now, but don't overlook the company's future. More than 33 million self-driving cars will be sold annually in 2040. Aptiv is gearing up for that world now, and investors should take notice of its potential.

Buckle up and enjoy the ride

We're still in the very early stages of the driverless-vehicle story, and much can happen to change the state of the industry. But between the steady expansion of Alphabet's Waymo, Tesla's early lead building expertise in the space, and Aptiv's central position as a pure play on the market, we think astute investors would do well to at least add these three stocks to their watch lists today."

222,0.9959,0.157,0.813,0.03,"Growth isn't everything in investing. Indeed, it only represents a fraction of what comprises a healthy company. But it's undoubtedly an important characteristic to look for when searching for companies worth holding for the long haul. After all, strong growth shows that more and more customers are willing to pay up for a company's products or services.

Two good examples of fast-growing companies are electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and programmatic digital advertising platform The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). Revenue is skyrocketing at both of these companies.

Here's a closer look.

Tesla

Electric-car maker Tesla saw its revenue surge in 2019, soaring 82% year over year. This revenue growth was primarily driven by a big increase in auto sales as the company started ramping up production of its most affordable vehicle yet: the Model 3. Tesla's total vehicle deliveries jumped 138% year over year in 2018.

Unfortunately, Tesla is still losing money on an annual basis. The capital-intensive nature of the auto business requires massive investment to grow production and revenue and it has been weighing on Tesla's rapid expansion. The company lost $5.72 per share in 2018. But investors should take heart in the fact that Tesla's 2018 loss was significantly narrower than its $11.83 loss per share in 2017. The company's narrowing annual loss is a good sign for Tesla's ability to become profitable as sales continue to rise.

In 2019, Tesla expects more strong growth. The company guided for total vehicle deliveries between 360,000 and 400,000, up 45% to 65% year over year. In addition, Tesla expects to be profitable and free cash flow positive in every quarter beyond the first quarter of 2019.

The Trade Desk

As advertisers have ramped up spending on The Trade Desk's programmatic ad-buying platform, the company's revenue rose 55% year over year last year -- an acceleration from 52% growth in 2017. The Trade Desk benefited from soaring ad spend across its digital channels. Notably, connected TV ad spend increased nine-fold in 2018 compared to 2017. Audio and mobile video ad spend jumped 230% and 130%, respectively, over the same timeframe.

Growth remained strong as the company exited the year, with revenue rising 56% year over year.

Unlike Tesla, The Trade Desk runs an extremely profitable operation. The company generated $88 million of net income on its $477 million of revenue in 2018, giving The Trade Desk an 18.5% net margin. Even more, this net income is rising sharply, climbing 73% year over year in 2018.

With a fresh overhaul to its platform complete and The Trade Desk's recent move to give marketers access to premium digital advertising inventory in China, strong growth should persist in 2019. Management guided for revenue of ""at least"" $637 million in 2019, representing 41% year-over-year growth or greater. But The Trade Desk's guidance has historically proved to be conservative."
223,0.9929,0.115,0.83,0.055,"If it seems like you're sharing the road with more and more Teslas (NASDAQ:TSLA) you're probably not imagining things.

Whether you see its cars on the road, its business strategy in the news, or its CEO in your Twitter feed, Tesla is one of the most buzzed-about companies in the world. But how exactly does it turn a profit?

In this video, we're going to break down exactly how Tesla makes its money, and where it might be headed in the years to come.

A full transcript follows the video.

Narrator: Tesla didn't invent the electric car -- that actually happened back in 1891. Instead, it did something a lot more interesting -- they made the electric car cool. When Tesla unveiled the Roadster in 2006, it began a wave of change in the auto industry that still continues today-- with virtually every major global automaker now sporting a plan to roll out EVs at volume in the coming years. In 2010, Tesla became the first publicly traded automaker to emerge in the US in 54 years and has delivered incredible returns to shareholders since, building one of the most loved car brands in the world.

Without a doubt, Tesla has changed the face of the car industry, but how does it make money?

In short, they don't. Throughout its history as a public company, Tesla has never been profitable on an annual basis, and has only recorded a few profitable quarters in its history.

However, Tesla has rapidly grown its revenue, booking $21 billion in annual sales in 2018. That's up nearly 7 times in the past 5 years and 183 times since it went public. Today, Tesla generates 93% of its revenues from automotive sales and around 7% from energy generation and storage.

How has Tesla accomplished such staggering growth? They had a plan.

Tesla's master plan entails 4 steps. 1) Create a low volume, expensive, high-end vehicle, 2) THEN Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price, 3) THEN use that money to create an affordable, high volume car, and 4) provide solar power.

Over the course of about a decade, Tesla carried out each step of its master plan one by one, beginning with production of its low volume, high-end Roadster sports car in 2008. 4 years later, Tesla began deliveries of its luxury Model S sedan. Tesla began deliveries of its Model X luxury SUV 3 years later, after several delays. 3 more years after that, Tesla finally introduced it's mass market Model 3 sedan. In January 2019, the Model 3 passed the Model S to become the top selling electric car in the history of the United States.

Meanwhile, in 2016, Tesla merged with SolarCity, completing the 4th prong of its Master Plan and positioning the company to sell its PowerWall energy storage units along with SolarCity solar panels and Tesla vehicles, allowing customers to power their home and vehicles entirely via solar power.

Despite Tesla's incredible growth over the past decade, and the completion of its Original Master Plan, threats still loom on the horizon.

Traditional automakers are aggressively entering the electric vehicle market, particularly on the high end that Tesla has dominated until now, with Audi (OTC:AUDV.F), Porsche (OTC:POAHF), Mercedes (OTC:DDAI.F), Volvo (NASDAQOTH: VOLVY), Jaguar (NYSE:TTM), and more releasing new vehicles in the coming year. Simultaneously, Tesla has began losing the benefit of US electric vehicle tax credits beginning in 2019. As competition enters the US market with the benefit of the full EV tax credit, Tesla's already unprofitable business will face increasing margin pressure that may impact its ability to continue investing in future growth in a highly capital intensive business like automaking.

Tesla will need to find a boatload of cash over the next few years in order to finance its already announced (and highly anticipated) upcoming projects like the Model Y, Tesla Semi, New Tesla Roadster, solar roof, and construction of the Chinese gigafactory.

In addition, Tesla faces regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, tracing back to CEO Elon Musk's fraudulent tweet that the company had funding secured to go private at $420. That incident, plus another tweet that incorrectly stated future production estimates has regulators watching Musk and Tesla very closely.

At best, the back and forth with regulators is a distraction at a point when the company is trying to secure its dominance of the EV market before competitors are able to enter. At worst, it could eventually rob the company of its CEO and the personification of its brand, potentially derailing its incredible growth story.

Time will tell whether Tesla can overcome these and other significant challenges facing the company today and someday achieve consistent profitability. Regardless, it's indisputable that Tesla has accomplished its goal of accelerating the move to sustainable transport."
224,0.9974,0.142,0.8,0.058,"The market expects Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

This electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +121.2%.

Revenues are expected to be $6.23 billion, up 82.9% from the year-ago quarter.

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tesla?

For Tesla, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.

So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tesla would post earnings of $2.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.93, delivering a surprise of -7.21%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Tesla doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."
225,0.9918,0.124,0.848,0.028,"On Monday, electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) published its first-ever "" Impact Report.""The new report ""measures the impact our products and operations have on the environment and our communities,"" Tesla said. More specifically, the report provides investors with an overview of how the company's products, operations, supply chain, and organizational culture are making progress when it comes to sustainability -- from both an environmental and a stakeholder perspective.

Here's a look at some key takeaways from the report.

Tesla's mission

The report offers a clear reminder of Tesla's mission, which is simply to ""accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.""

In other words, Tesla believes rising global CO2 emissions are unsustainable, making a revolution necessary in both the generation and the consumption of energy. But Tesla believes there is a way it can help.

And the world cannot address its energy habits without directly reducing emissions in the transportation and power sectors. This issue is Tesla's entire reason for existing. We are focused on creating a complete power and transportation ecosystem from solar generation and energy storage to all-electric vehicles.

Environmental impact

While Tesla's global environmental impact is still small relative to the 35 gigatons of annual CO2 emissions produced annually, the company is on a path to make a meaningful impact. Tesla estimates its fully electric fleet has averted more than 4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions over the 10 billion miles its 550,000 vehicles have driven.

Meanwhile, the company has installed over 3.5 gigawatts of solar installations and generated more than 13 terawatt-hours of emissions-free electricity. ""To put 13 TWhs in perspective, this amount of energy could supply the annual residential electricity consumption for the entire state of Connecticut,"" Tesla said.

The company is also aiding a transition to sustainable energy by providing battery-based energy storage solutions. Its 129 megawatt-hour powerpack system, combined with a wind farm near Jamestown, South Australia, is an example of a grid-scale energy storage project providing a zero-emissions solution.

Vehicle safety

Tesla also boasts about its vehicles' safety, which is demonstrated both by their five-star safety ratings and by lower crash occurrences when Tesla's driver-assist Autopilot system is activated.

In Q1 2019, we registered one accident for every 2.87M miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot, we registered one accident for every 1.76M miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA's most recent data shows that in the United States there is an automobile crash every 436K miles.

Other factors discussed in the report include Tesla's efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations, including manufacturing, retail, distribution, sales, Supercharger network, and more; recycling initiatives; the company's commitment to use only responsibly produced materials; and diversity and inclusion.

While an update like this may not be material to any investing thesis in the near term, Tesla's qualitative and quantitative efforts to track its impact on the environment and on stakeholders can help the company stay focused on its mission while helping investors better understand its goals and progress."
226,0.999,0.127,0.843,0.03,"Unless you've been living under a rock for the past couple of years, you've probably been hearing about the marijuana industry almost nonstop -- and there's a good reason for that. It's not often that we see an industry blossom from a few billion dollars a year in global sales to perhaps up to $75 billion in annual sales over a 15-year period. This is the type of growth that comes around once in a generation, and investors don't want to miss out.

Naturally, most of the focus on the pot industry is with the direct players. In other words, marijuana growers, cannabis distributors, and vertically integrated dispensary operators have been garnering most of Wall Street's and investors' attention.

Energy stocks could power your portfolio amid the cannabis boom

However, ancillary industries and sectors are primed to benefit from the marijuana boom, too. Examples would include banking, packaging solutions, and even real estate. But one sector that is frequently overlooked, but is liable to play a big role in the long-term outlook for the U.S. marijuana industry, is energy.

The U.S. cannabis industry is currently eating up more than 1% of all electricity each year. Keep in mind that it's not even legal at the federal level, so you can imagine how much electricity the industry would be using, and what demand would be placed on electric grids, if marijuana were legalized across the country. The needs to reduce greenhouse emissions created by the weed industry, as well as lower electric load and expenditures, makes the energy sector a clear beneficiary of a budding cannabis industry.

How can you take advantage, you ask? Here are three energy stocks that could be worth a look.

1. Bet on solar

As reported by online publication FastCompany.com, luxury cannabis company Canndescent out in Desert Hot Springs, California, recently had a 282.6-kilowatt solar system installed that could power up to half of its grow operations. Per Canndescent, this is the first on-site solar installation for a large-scale cannabis farm in the United States.

As outlined by FastCompany, getting approval for solar projects isn't necessarily a walk in the park for marijuana companies. That's because most banks won't offer basic financial services to the industry, albeit bills in Congress may soon change this. Additionally, pot companies aren't necessarily able to take advantage of renewable energy credits like most businesses, which makes installation of solar panels that much more expensive.

But the benefits are pretty obvious if marijuana growers are in it for the long haul. Aside from sizable up-front expenses, solar panels significantly reduce electricity costs in sunny growing regions of the country, and they're environmentally friendly, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

An energy stock I'd encourage investors to watch in this regard is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), the largest utility stock in the country. NextEra currently generates more energy from wind and solar power than any other utility, and it's planning to invest $40 billion through 2020 in various renewable-energy projects.

In particular, NextEra Energy's subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is already operating 18 solar power plants in the Sunshine State that are capable of producing 1,250 megawatts of combined solar capacity. In 2019, FPL is adding four new solar sites, which builds on FPL's plan to install 30 million more solar panels in the state by 2030 (also known as the 30-by-30 initiative). These solar panels will be critical to low-cost production for cannabis growers that have been flocking to the Florida marketplace in the early going.

2. Electricity storage could be the answer

Aside from simply generating lower-cost electricity from solar, growers are likely to look at ways to purchase and store electricity in order to save costs. That's where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) comes into play.

Tesla is, of course, best known for its line of electric vehicles, ranging from its low-end Model 3 sedan to its luxury Model S. But it's also an energy company, with gigafactories cranking out lithium-ion batteries, supercharger networks scattered throughout the United States, its acquisition of Solar City providing a commercial and residential solar panel-leasing platform, and its Powerwall and Powerpack providing residential and commercial customers the opportunity to store electricity.

Right now, cannabis growers are more or less at the mercy of the pricing structure of their utility provider. Since growers tend to be such a strain on electrical grids, pot companies can pay a lot of money to keep their cannabis plants growing. This is where Tesla's Powerapack would come in handy. With Powerpack, growers would be able to purchase electricity in bulk during non-peak hours, when electricity rates are marginally lower, then store it. When electricity rates near their peak, growers would use their stored electricity to hedge their costs.

How much would this really save marijuana growers? Although it's tough to say since no large-scale cannabis grower has attempted it before, the expectation is that it would result in only a few cents of savings per kilowatt-hour. However, for large grow farms, a few cents in savings per kilowatt-hour would be significant over time.

As with solar projects, financing a commercial storage unit like Tesla's Powerpack would be difficult for most cannabis growers at the moment, but that may soon change. That makes Tesla an intriguing energy stock to watch as the marijuana industry grows.

3. It could be as simple as light bulbs

Finally, investors would be smart to keep their eyes on the little things in the growing process, such as light bulbs.

For a long time now, high-pressure sodium (HPS) bulbs have been a staple for the cannabis industry. HPS bulbs are relatively inexpensive to purchase and they yield highly predictable results, which is a reason growers have stuck with them for so long. But these are also bulbs that eat up a ton of electricity, and they tend to generate a lot of heat. That's a problem for indoor grow sites, which almost always means installing a cooling system that (you got it) also eats up a lot of electricity.

The answer might be LED light bulbs and lighting systems from Cree (NASDAQ:CREE). LED lights use far less electricity than traditional HPS bulbs, they generate much less heat, which can help reduce cooling system expenses, and they also last much longer than HPS bulbs.

So, why haven't Cree's LED lights become the industry standard? The first reason is that LED bulbs cost substantially more than HPS bulbs upfront, although the long-term costs would seem to favor LEDs due to their lower operating cost and longer life expectancy. And second, yields from LED lights aren't as well known within the industry, so it's tough to get growers to shift from what they're comfortable with.

However, if Cree continues to improve the life of its products while, at the same time, reducing production costs in China, there's the very real possibility that the marijuana industry could regularly use LEDs to lower their long-term production costs."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors just can't seem to catch a break.

Since rebounding off their lows from the great tech sell-off of 2018, Tesla shares have been in free fall -- down more than $100 (or 29%) since about mid-December on manifold bad news headlines. Last week, the stock suffered from news that Model 3 sedan production was stalling and Model 3 deliveries were falling. Today, shares are getting hit by reports that Tesla has decided to cut electric battery production in line with stagnant electric car sales.

Here's what you need to know.

Gigafactory shorts out

This morning, TheFly.com cites a report from Nikkei Asian Review warning that Tesla and Gigafactory partner Panasonic are putting on hold plans to expand Gigafactory 1 battery production by 50%.

Within this mammoth, 15 million-square-foot Nevada factory, Panasonic builds rechargeable electric car batteries, and Tesla assembles them into battery packs for its cars -- among them the Model 3. But with Model 3 sales leveling off, the case for making additional investment in expanding production capacity has weakened, and Nikkei Asian Review says the companies have been forced to rethink their plans. Adding to the worries, there are rumors that Panasonic may also be having doubts about the companies' planned, jointly operated Shanghai, China, Gigafactory.

Roth reacts

It didn't take Wall Street long to react to the Nikkei report. This morning, analysts at Roth Capital cut their price target on Tesla from $270 to $240 a share. Despite the fact that Roth maintains a neutral rating on the stock, the new target -- implying a 10% downside risk -- suggests that Roth is actually more pessimistic about Tesla's chances than its rating lets on.

Roth wasn't coy about its reasons for cutting its price target, either. Directly referencing the story in Nikkei, the analyst noted: ""The direct read on Panasonic/Tesla suspending plans for Gigafactory expansion is the partners probably do not see Tesla achieving projected sales volumes, and therefore necessary battery demand."" The analyst then went a step further, though, in a note covered by StreetInsider.com (subscription required), blaming ""too high"" battery costs at Tesla for the failure of its Model 3 to sustain sales growth.

Roth notes that Tesla powercells probably cost about $240 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which means that the 62 kWh battery pack in a midrange Model 3 adds nearly $15,000 to the car's cost. A long-range battery pack, rated at 74 kWh, would add nearly $18,000. Granted, other automakers entering the electric car race face even higher costs. (The analyst notes that Volkswagen, for example, is probably paying about $250/kWh.) But even so, the upshot is that the vast scale of Tesla/Panasonic's Gigafactory doesn't appear to be translating into significant reductions in battery cost.

Or as Roth puts it: ""Tesla has no advantage here.""

What it means to investors

That's a frighteningly blunt statement for Tesla investors, given how much faith has been invested in the company's efforts to gain scale in battery production, with the goal of lowering battery costs and underpricing its competitors. But the numbers seem to bear it out.

Currently, S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows that Tesla's gross profit margin of 18.8% is precisely equal to Volkswagen's 18.8% gross margin -- while Volkswagen's operating and net margins for last year were positive. (Tesla's weren't, although it did score positive profit margin in the year's second half.)

Now, it's still possible that Roth is too negative on Tesla and is prejudging the company's performance too soon. Tesla is only just now getting up to speed on Model 3 production, after all, and isn't yet reaping the full economies of scale that it might eventually expect to gain from all-out production rates at its soon-to-be-multiple Gigafactories. Furthermore, there's a movement afoot in Congress to double the number of electric cars per manufacturer eligible for federal $7,500 income tax credits. If that initiative bears fruit, it could well goose Tesla's sales growth once again, spur demand for additional production, and support demand for Gigafactory batteries -- perhaps leading to reductions in battery cost.

For now, however, it's fear of renewed losses for Tesla that's winning the day over greed in anticipation of greater Tesla sales -- and Tesla stock is going down."
228,0.8929,0.065,0.888,0.047,"""Tesla and Panasonic are freezing plans to expand the capacity of their Gigafactory 1,"" asserted Asian business publication Nikkei in a new report this week. The move follows Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) worse-than-expected first-quarter vehicle deliveries -- figures that were weighed down by a significant decrease in Model S and X sales.

Tesla shares fell more than 3% Thursday morning as investors considered whether this is a sign of weaker-than-expected demand for the company's vehicles.

Panasonic to watch the ""demand situation""

Responding to Nikkei 's report, Panasonic (OTC:PCRF.Y) said it is ""watching the demand situation,"" according to Reuters. The Japanese battery specialist ""will study additional investments over 35 [gigawatt-hour production capacity] in collaboration with Tesla,"" the company said.

Tesla's deliveries have increased significantly on a year-over-year basis recently, requiring unprecedented battery production volume. Gigafactory 1 in Nevada has a battery-production capacity of 35 gigawatt-hours, making it the largest battery factory in the world. Further investments in battery production were expected from both companies. But if demand for Tesla's current production and delivery volume can't be sustained, incremental investment could be put on hold until the demand situation improves.

Nikkei 's report also said that the Japanese company is suspending its planned investment in Tesla's under-construction Gigafactory in Shanghai. ""Instead, it will provide technical support and a small number of batteries from the Gigafactory,"" wrote Nikkei 's Daishi Chiba and Itsuro Fujino. ""Tesla is committed to buying batteries for the cars built at the Shanghai factory from a number of makers.""

Tesla downplayed the report. ""We will of course continue to make new investments in Gigafactory 1, as needed,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. ""However, we think there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than was previously estimated.""

Deliveries are soaring on a year-over-year basis

Tesla's new Model 3, which accounts for the bulk of the company's total deliveries, is by no means a flop. Though Tesla's vehicle deliveries fell 31% sequentially, they are up 110% year over year thanks to rising Model 3 sales. Trailing-12-month vehicle deliveries are up 158% year over year. In addition, rising Model 3 production and deliveries last year meant that in terms of revenue, the vehicle was the best-selling passenger car in the U.S. during the second half of the year.

Providing further support for its demand narrative, just last week Tesla reaffirmed its guidance for 2019 deliveries to be between 360,000 and 400,000 -- up 45% to 65% compared to 2018.

While there's a chance that demand for Tesla's vehicles isn't as robust as management expected, a sequential decline in a single quarter -- particularly when deliveries are soaring on a year-over-year basis -- isn't a reason for investors to be too concerned. But if quarterly deliveries can't resume growth sequentially in the coming quarters, investors (and management) -- may have to lower their expectations."

Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories
1. In a major development, Volkswagen AG (VWAGY - Free Report) announced that it started testing self-driving vehicles in Hamburg, Germany, per CNBC. This is the first time that instance of the German auto giant conducting automated vehicle test runs in real conditions in a major German city.
The tests, being conducted by Volkswagen Group Research, will feature five specially equipped e-Golfs, driving on a three-kilometer stretch of a road. The highly autonomous vehicles have laser scanners, ultrasonic sensors, radars and cameras. The vehicles will have drivers behind the steering wheel to examine performance and take control in the event of an emergency.
The computing power of 15 laptops has been installed in the e-Golf trunk. This alongside the sensor technology will equip the vehicle to gather different data related to cyclists, pedestrians, other vehicles and intersections.
In order to make self-driving comfortable and safer, vehicles not only have to become more intelligent but the city must also facilitate digital infrastructure. A nine-kilometer “digital test bed” for connected and automated driving is being built in Hamburg. This is likely to be completed in 2020.

2. A few days after the report of a decline in production and deliveries in first-quarter 2019, Tesla announced another round of job cut, per Bloomberg. This electric vehicle manufacturer axed several members from sales teams in Chicago; Brooklyn, NY; and Tampa, FL.
The total number of employees dismissed has not been revealed by the company. This move is in sync with its plan of lowering staff as part of the retail retrenchment strategy adopted in February 2019. The chief executive officer of Tesla, Elon Musk outlined the strategy to shut some showrooms and switch to online-only ordering model to ramp up the production process.
Notably, in the first quarter of 2019, the company’s vehicle production and delivery numbers witnessed sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively. During the quarter, this electric automaker struggled with Model 3 deliveries to Europe and China, owing to longer transit time.
In a bid to cut costs, Tesla slashed employees, who delivered cars in the United States, and opted for store closures. In fact, in February, Elon Musk indicated that the company would evaluate all areas of sales and marketing in the following weeks. He further gave hints of job cuts and employee transition to different parts of the company. (Read more: T Tesla Opts for Another Round of Sales Job Reduction)

3. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU - Free Report) is about to pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the U.S. investors in 2015, per Reuters. Shareholders charged this automaker on claims that they were misinformed that the vehicles were in compliance with diesel emission and federal safety regulations.
Further, the investor group claimed that they lost money when shares tumbled on reports of Fiat Chrysler’s failure to properly undertake the vehicle recall. The settlement for investors, who bought shares between Oct 13, 2014, and May 23, 2017, must be approved by a federal judge, per Bloomberg.
Despite paying the settlement, Fiat Chrysler disagrees with claims issued by the investor group in the lawsuit. Its insurance will be used to pay for the settlement.
Prior to this, the company agreed on a settlement with Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), which cost it roughly $800 million in January 2019. EPA sued this automaker on charges of using illegal engine-control software in diesel vehicles to pass emissions tests in 2017.

4. Ford’s Brazil unit announced that it initiated a voluntary layoff program for the plant in Camacari, Bahia, per Reuters. The company informed that this move is in sync with the strategy of restructuring operations and cutting the excess workforce.
The exact number of employees to be laid off has not been revealed by the company. However, the plant in Camacari produces the compact Ka and mid-sized EcoSport SUV, and employs 7,400 people. Earlier, Ford revealed that the plant was operating with 700 excess workers.
Notably, the company sold 24,000 Ka vehicles in Brazil in first-quarter 2019, almost flat year over year. Also, it sold 7,600 EcoSports, more than 7,000 reported in first-quarter 2018. A couple of months ago, as part of the restructuring move and to cut losses, the company made the announcement of closing the oldest plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil. This move could lead to the layoff of 2,700 workers.
Nevertheless, the recent move to initiate a voluntary layoff program for the plant in Camacari, Bahia, is due to its objectives to align the workforce with current market demand. (Read more: Ford Initiates Voluntary Layoff Program for Brazil Plant))

5. Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY - Free Report) announced that its premium brand, Infiniti, will come out with the first electric vehicle in around three years, per Reuters. The sporty electric sedan will be produced in China, which holds a lot of promise for electric vehicles. It is expected that the e-sedan would be on a new flexible architecture, which will be very useful for accommodating electrified powertrains. Also, its interior design will be considerably different from current models.
This move is in sync with this Japanese automaker’s long-term strategy to electrify the product line up on a massive scale. Previously, Nissan revealed the plan to make Infiniti predominantly an electrified offering. From 2021 onward, all vehicles under the Infiniti brand will be either an all-electric vehicle or of e-Power version.
Intensified competition in the electric car market in China led startups as well as established players to launch several vehicle models. In order to comply with official quotas, automakers in China are raising the production of new-energy vehicles, either battery electric cars or plug-in electric hybrids. The proposed e-sedans from Nissan are likely to face competition from established players. (Read more: Nissan to Introduce First Electric Sedan in China )"
230,0.992,0.126,0.842,0.032,"Shares of electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded higher on Wednesday, rising 1.4%. The stock's gain follows a report from Reuters that a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation this week to improve the tax credit for electric vehicles. The current credit begins phasing out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 qualifying vehicles. A new credit, however, would significantly expand this limit.

Obviously, since every vehicle Tesla produces is fully electric, the bill could be both a significant and material demand driver for the automaker.

Meet the Driving America Forward Act

The new bill, which is called the Driving America Forward Act, proposes granting automakers 400,000 additional qualifying electric vehicle sales on top of the first 200,000 that already qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, which go to buyers of the vehicles. For the additional 400,000 vehicles, the bill would allow buyers to earn a $7,000 tax credit.

The new bill, however, would have a shorter phase-out period, sunsetting over a nine-month period after a manufacturer sells an additional 400,000 vehicles on top of the 200,000 that qualified for the current tax credit. That compares with the current credit's 15-month phase-out period after a manufacturer sells its 200,000th electric vehicle.

The new bill is ""sponsored by Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, Republican Sens. Lamar Alexander and Susan Collins, and Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee,"" Reuters said.

The bill would cost about $11.4 billion, with the bulk of it going to the proposed electric-vehicle tax credit.

A timely catalyst

If this bill passes, it could provide a timely lift to demand for Tesla vehicles.

The company's most recent deliveries fell short of expectations as demand for the automaker's pricier Model S and X seems to have taken a hit amid the phase-out of the current tax credit for Tesla. Management predicted in its fourth-quarter update that it ""likely saw a pull-forward of demand in the U.S. for Model S and Model X into 2018"" as a result of the credit's Jan. 1 reduction. On Jan. 1, the tax credit for buyers of Tesla vehicles was cut in half to $3,750, as the automaker recently crossed the 200,000 cumulative electric vehicle sales threshold. But deliveries of the two vehicles were much lower than Tesla had guided for, suggesting demand suffered significantly.

An expanded electric-vehicle tax credit could also help spur demand for Tesla's lower-cost, higher volume Model 3, just as the company is ramping up the vehicle's production.

The existing credit is scheduled to fall to $1,875 in July and be eliminated entirely by the end of the year for Tesla buyers.

The proposed new electric-vehicle tax credit will be attached to tax legislation for consideration within the next couple of months, supporters hope. Of course, the bill could see intense opposition. Indeed, the Trump administration's recent 2020 budget proposal advised ending the electric-vehicle tax credit entirely, saving the U.S. government an estimated $2.5 billion over a decade."

As of just after 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down 15 points to 26,135.

Earnings season is just about to begin, and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) got an early start by announcing its latest results. Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors turned their attention to Washington, with the hope that lawmakers will extend additional valuable tax credits to buyers of electric vehicles above and beyond what they've already done in past years.

Delta's ready for takeoff

Delta Air Lines saw its stock rise about half a percent following the airline's release of first-quarter financial results. The company said that its earnings per share jumped 28% from year-earlier levels on an adjusted basis, with total adjusted revenue rising at a healthy 7.5% clip.

Delta cited several contributing factors to its positive performance. Nonfuel unit expenses were down for the third quarter in a row, showing the airline's commitment to cost containment. Delta's efforts to take advantage of value-added opportunities showed up clearly in its top-line figures, where 55% of revenue came from non-ticket sources or from premium offerings. Corporate revenue in the U.S. market was especially strong, and Delta also said that its extended card agreement with American Express added about a percentage point to its 2.4% rise in unit revenue.

Delta sees clear skies ahead. ""With the momentum in our business and our American Express contract renewal,"" said CEO Ed Bastian, ""we have increased confidence in achieving our full-year plan."" That includes positive guidance for the second quarter, including 6% to 8% sales growth, 1.5% to 3.5% gains in revenue per available seat mile, and earnings of $2.05 to $2.35 per share. Many investors continue to see Delta as the leader of the airline pack, and today's results provide evidence of the company's strength.

A less taxing Tesla?

Shares of Tesla rose 1% as investors tried to assess the potential for what could be a nice boost to its electric vehicle business. Reports surfaced this morning that lawmakers on Capitol Hill will propose new legislation that would expand the electric vehicle tax credit that Tesla buyers have been able to use to offset the cost of their vehicles.

Currently, the electric vehicle tax credit pays $7,500 to purchasers until a manufacturer sells 200,000 vehicles. At that point, the credit starts to phase out over a 15-month period. Tesla has already seen some of that impact, as its credit fell to $3,750 at the beginning of the year. By the end of 2019, the current law would eliminate the credit entirely for Tesla buyers.

The new legislation seeks to offer additional tax credits of $7,000 for up to 400,000 more vehicles per manufacturer. The current $7,500 figure would still remain in place for manufacturers that haven't yet hit the initial 200,000 limit, and the new $7,000 credit would phase out over nine months instead of 15. That makes the bill attractive not just for Tesla but for just about every automaker serving the U.S. market, most of which already have electric vehicle development plans in place.

Investors weren't happy with Tesla's most recent news on deliveries, and the fact that tax credits have been on the decline has weighed on even the most optimistic of Tesla's fans. Adding new credits would breathe new life into Tesla's value proposition for buyers and potentially reinvigorate interest in electric vehicles across the auto industry."

233,0.9627,0.084,0.895,0.022,"Investors in Tesla, Inc. (TSLA - Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 17, 2019 $50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.
What is Implied Volatility?
Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.
Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Tesla shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Tesla is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Automotive - Domestic industry that ranks in the Top 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 75 cents per share to 58 cents in that period.
Given the way analysts feel about Tesla right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

234,0.2637,0.08,0.842,0.078,"In the first few months of 2019, there were plenty of warning signs that all was not well at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The electric vehicle pioneer implemented numerous price changes -- mainly reducing prices -- and began taking orders for the long-awaited $35,000 base version of the Model 3, hinting at a growing desperation to boost sales.

Nevertheless, there was no firm proof that Tesla was having trouble selling its cars -- until now.

On Wednesday, Tesla reported dreadful production and deliveries totals for the first quarter. It seems increasingly clear that Model 3 demand is not living up to bulls' lofty expectations, while sales of the pricier Model S and Model X are in free fall.

Model 3 demand fails to impress

Tesla built 62,950 Model 3s last quarter and delivered 50,900. Both figures represented big increases on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter of 2018, Tesla built fewer than 10,000 Model 3s -- and delivered 8,180 of them -- as it was still early in the process of ramping up production.

That said, looking at things on a sequential basis casts Tesla's Q1 performance in a different light. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Tesla built 61,394 Model 3s and delivered 63,150.

The sequential decline in deliveries can mostly be attributed to higher in-transit inventory as Tesla abruptly shifted its delivery mix toward Europe and China rather than the U.S. But even adjusting for that headwind, it appears that Model 3 production and sales have peaked. The only hope for a return to meaningful growth is that Tesla's move to open a factory in China will allow it to significantly reduce prices in that key market.

Tesla tried to put a positive spin on things by stating that Model 3 orders in the U.S. significantly outpaced deliveries in the first quarter. However, that's not as impressive as it sounds, since the majority of Model 3 deliveries went to overseas customers during Q1.

InsideEVs estimates that Tesla delivered 22,425 Model 3s in the U.S. last quarter. (Tesla doesn't provide a country-by-country breakdown.) In other words, Tesla's statement could be consistent with receiving only 30,000 Model 3 orders in the U.S. during Q1. That would be a bad sign for the company, given that it plans to build nearly 100,000 Model 3s per quarter at its factory in Fremont, California, by year-end and the U.S. has historically accounted for the majority of Tesla's sales.

A sales wipeout for the Model S and Model X

While the Model 3 gets most of the headlines these days, the Model S and Model X were a big part of Tesla turning profitable in the second half of 2018. Indeed, gross margin for those pricey models rose to around 30% during that period. As a result, the Model S and Model X likely generated about half of Tesla's gross profit in the back half of the year, despite accounting for less than a third of its total deliveries.

Unfortunately, Tesla delivered just 12,100 Model S and Model X vehicles combined last quarter. That was down from 27,550 a quarter earlier and 21,800 in the first quarter of 2018.

There are a number of possible causes of this sales plunge. The partial phase-out of federal tax credits in the U.S. may have pulled forward some demand into 2018. Better availability of the Model 3 is another factor that could be weighing on demand for pricier Teslas. Trade tensions may be impacting sales in China. Growing competition in the electric vehicle market certainly can't be overlooked. And the recent Model Y reveal could be causing some potential buyers to consider waiting for that model.

Yet one thing is certain. There aren't any meaningful production constraints to blame for the sales decline -- it's all about demand. The only question is how much Tesla is willing to cut prices (at the cost of lower gross margin) to prop up Model S and Model X sales volume going forward.

2019 could be a rough year for Tesla

Tesla noted that a substantial number of deliveries shifted from the first quarter to the second quarter, due to challenges encountered while trying to dramatically increase deliveries in Europe and China. That -- along with initial availability of the $35,000 Model 3 and another step-down in the federal tax credit for Tesla purchases on July 1 -- should be enough to drive a sequential increase in Model 3 deliveries this quarter.

However, getting Model S and Model X output back to the prior rate of about 25,000 deliveries per quarter will be very challenging. Furthermore, Tesla's plan to ramp up Model 3 production over the course of 2019 seems extremely unrealistic. Falling wait times suggest that there may not even be enough demand to support the current production rate after Tesla burns through the initial backlog of demand in Europe and China.

To make matters worse, Tesla's operational challenges and price cuts, as well as the steep drop in Model S and Model X demand, will severely impact the company's profitability and cash flow in 2019. Some analysts expect Tesla to burn more than $1 billion of cash this year, which would leave its balance sheet in a perilous state unless it manages to raise more capital.

Tesla bulls can hope that new products like the Model Y, Tesla Semi, and a future Tesla pickup truck will help turn things around. Yet by the time those models arrive in 2020 and beyond, Tesla could be in a much weaker state than it is today -- and facing more competition than ever."
235,0.6549,0.062,0.891,0.047,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 12.5% in March, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, with the stock reacting to a whirlwind of company news including shifts in the way the electric vehicle manufacturer operates, a new model release, and ongoing uncertainty about the automaker's standing with regulators and its cash reserves.

So what

The Tesla news cycle goes so fast, it's hard to pin a month's stock move on any one news item, and March seemed particularly busy for the electric car maker. Tesla began the month by paying a $920 million convertible bond obligation in cash, leading to investor questions about the health of its balance sheet and its cash reserves that were compounded on March 12, when the company conducted another round of layoffs.

Tesla also announced, and then walked back, a plan to close its retail locations in favor of moving all sales online, and adjusted vehicle pricing. All the while, company CEO Elon Musk was embroiled in a dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission over whether his tweets exaggerated the company's prospects.

The company also in March unveiled a new vehicle, the Model Y crossover SUV, though the announcement fell short of investor expectations.

Now what

The Tesla news machine didn't slam on the brakes just because the calendar changed. So far in April, the company has reported first-quarter deliveries that missed estimates by a significant margin and announced an over-the-air update to its Autopilot software.

Tesla is a company that inspires passion, both from bulls and bears, and the argument is likely to rage on until the company is either consistently profitable or out of business. The thing I'm most interested in seeing over the months to come is whether there's sustained demand for the Model 3 vehicles Tesla is producing.

We've heard a lot about the Model 3's initial strong reservations, but between the rapid-fire changes in strategy and the reports of cars sitting on lots, I remain skeptical there is enough demand for Tesla's current product lineup to alleviate concerns about the company's balance sheet."
236,0.9762,0.064,0.936,0.0,"Earlier this week, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced another software update for its vehicles. The update, which brought Tesla vehicles a step closer to autonomous driving, highlighted how rapidly the automaker can deploy a significant new feature -- all through a seamless over-the-air update.

Here's a look.

Navigate on Autopilot gets a major upgrade

On Wednesday, Tesla announced an update for its Navigate on Autopilot feature, making it ""more seamless.""

Navigate on Autopilot is a feature that started rolling out to customers last October, enabling highway on-ramp to off-ramp navigation based on a driver's designated destination. But the driver-assist feature fell short of a total on-ramp to off-ramp experience: Although it made lane changes for the driver, the driver had to approve suggested lane changes with the turn stalk. Tesla's latest update for Navigate on Autopilot importantly removes the requirement to confirm lane changes and gives customers more control over the feature through the Autopilot settings menu.

Specifically, the over-the-air update gives drivers three settings to choose from. One setting lets drivers choose whether Navigate on Autopilot is turned on automatically (for the highway portion of the drive) every time a driver enters a navigation route. A second setting gives drivers the option to require a confirmation from the driver before lane changes are executed. Finally, a third option gives drivers an option to be notified of an upcoming lane change with an audible chime and a visual prompt.

With the help of the company's internal testing and Early Access Program, over ""a half a million miles have already been driven with lane change confirmation turned off,"" Tesla said in its update this week. This validation, combined with the company's over-the-air update technology, means Tesla was able to start rolling out updates to owners who have purchased enhanced autopilot or prepurchased full self-driving capability immediately.

This over-the-air update joins a few other notable updates recently, including one earlier this month that improved the range and acceleration of Tesla's long-range Model 3 and a feature that enables Tesla vehicles to slowly, autonomously navigate through parking lots to their owners.

Just the beginning

Based on another announcement from Tesla last week, there's apparently much more to come on this front. The company announced it is unveiling its in-house-developed full self-driving (FSD) computer at an event in Palo Alto, California, on April 22. At the event, Tesla executives will discuss the computer and give test-drives to experience features that are ""under active development.""

While manufacturing has been -- and continues to be -- the electric-car maker's greatest challenge, software could represent its most important opportunity. Even more, Tesla's ability to quickly and seamlessly roll out such substantial software updates shows how the company's software prowess may give Tesla a significant technological edge over competitors."
237,0.9522,0.07,0.888,0.042,"Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) first-quarter deliveries missed estimates by a significant margin, sparking a sharp sell-off in the electric automaker's stock on Thursday. The company produced and delivered 77,100 and 63,000 vehicles, respectively, in the period. Those were meaningful sequential decreases, and the numbers missed analysts' average estimates for 84,700 produced and 74,900 delivered.

Despite that, there was an important silver lining in the first-quarter update: Model 3 demand remains strong. Recent price cuts and a reduction to the company's workforce earlier this year had led some watchers to worry that demand might be sliding for the company's newest vehicle. But those concerns may be overblown.

Robust Model 3 demand

The developing demand story for the Model 3 is critical to any thesis for owning Tesla stock. The automaker ultimately hopes deliveries for the vehicle will rise to around half a million units per year. Further, the company's forecast that its total vehicle deliveries will rise about 55% in fiscal 2019 is highly dependent on a huge increase in Model 3 sales.

Fortunately, production, deliveries, and demand for the vehicle all remain strong.

In Q1, Tesla produced a record 62,950 Model 3 units -- up from 61,394 units in the fourth quarter or 2018. Tesla's 50,900 Model 3 deliveries were below the 63,150 delivered in Q4, but the bulk of Tesla's 10,600 vehicles in transit to customers at the end of the Q1 were Model 3 units; the automaker only had 1,010 Model 3 units in transit to customers at the end of Q4 2018.

Further, Tesla said U.S. orders for Model 3 ""significantly outpaced what we were able to deliver in Q1."" While the company offered no details about overseas orders for the vehicle, they're apparently good enough for Tesla to reaffirm its impressive guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 total vehicle deliveries in 2019 -- a range that would be 45% to 65% higher than the 2018 number.

Zooming out

While it's easy to focus on the sequential decrease in Tesla's Model 3 deliveries, investors should be wary of getting too caught up in quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Since Tesla doesn't advertise, it's likely to take some time for its word-of-mouth marketing strategy to build sales momentum. That was the case with Tesla's Model S, too, as trailing-12-month sales steadily rose during the time between the vehicle's launch in 2012 to an annualized sales volume of around 50,000 units by the end of 2015 -- a level where it has mostly remained (give or take around 5,000 units in any given trailing-12-month period) ever since.

""As more people see our car on the road, take a test drive or talk with another Model S owner, more demand is created for our product,"" Tesla said regarding its low-key marketing tactics in its Q3 2013 shareholder letter.

Further, when zooming out from quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Tesla's total vehicle deliveries, they're notably soaring on a year-over-year basis. Deliveries were up 110% in Q1. In addition, deliveries are up 158% year over year on a trailing-12-month basis.

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were slammed on Thursday, falling as much as 10.7%. As of 10:53 a.m. EDT, the stock was down 8.4%.

The decline comes after the electric-car maker announced worse-than-expected first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries on Wednesday evening.

So what

Deliveries for the quarter came in at 63,000, up 110% year over year but down 31% sequentially. On average, analysts expected Tesla to deliver 74,900 vehicles.

Production was also lower than expected for the quarter. Tesla produced 77,100 vehicles, compared to the consensus analyst estimate for 84,700. The primary reason for this shortfall was a 45% year-over-year decrease in Tesla's combined Model S and X production. Model 3 production of 62,950 vehicles, which was at a record high, was only 2.3% lower than analysts' average forecast.

The sequential decline in total vehicle deliveries was primarily due to challenges with the company's expansion to Europe and China.

Now what

Difficulties with shipping vehicles to customers overseas and several price cuts made during the quarter are expected to negatively impact net income, Tesla said. A loss for the period is likely since such a substantial drop in the sales of the company's pricier, higher-margin Model S and X will weigh heavily on results."

241,0.9944,0.124,0.849,0.027,"Tesla, Inc. ’s (TSLA - Free Report) vehicle production and delivery numbers witnessed sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2019. It managed to produce roughly 77,100 vehicles — consisting of 62,950 Model 3, and 14,150 Model S and X. Out of the total delivered figure of 63,000 units, Tesla’s Model 3 accounted for 50,900 while Model S and X were 12,100.
During the quarter, this electric automaker struggled with Model 3 deliveries to Europe and China, owing to longer transit time. Nevertheless, several analysts anticipated the fall in deliveries as Tesla shifted to international markets with Model 3 for the first time. The company started delivering new Model 3 to China and Europe markets in January and February, amid a slowdown in demand in North America.
Tesla’s Model 3 shipments to international markets faced a few bumps in the last quarter, per Reuters. Misprinted labels delayed the shipments’ arrival in Shanghai while it faced unexpected challenges at the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. Longer transit time to deliver in international markets will likely to hurt Tesla’s working capital. The company reported having 10,600 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter compared with 1,900 in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Tesla, Inc. Price and Consensus | Tesla, Inc. Quote

Apart from managing transit time for international shipments, Tesla has to compete with Europe automakers that are launching several versions of electric vehicles, per Reuters.
Despite all such challenges ahead, the company did not lower the delivery guidance for 2019. For the current year, it reiterated its prior guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries. Also, it has been taking several steps to improve margins and generate profit in 2019. In a bid to cut costs, Tesla slashed employees, who delivered cars in the United States, and opted for store closures.
Shares of the company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. Over this time frame, it has lost 12.9% against the industry’s growth of 3.3%.

242,0.3182,0.059,0.892,0.049,"Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted its vehicle production and delivery numbers for its first quarter of 2019 on Wednesday evening. Though first-quarter deliveries were expected to decline sequentially, they were much lower than expected -- primarily because of a sharp decrease in Model S and X deliveries.

However, Model 3 production ticked higher sequentially. Still, troubles with shipping vehicles overseas meant deliveries of the important vehicle were still well below what they were in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Here's a closer look.

Tesla's first-quarter production and deliveries

The automaker produced 77,100 vehicles during Q1, down from 86,555 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Production was significantly lower than expected. On average, analysts were expecting Tesla to produce 84,700 vehicles.

Total deliveries came in at about 63,000 units, much lower than Tesla's nearly 91,000 deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2018 and about 12,000 less than analysts were expecting.

The significant difference in production and deliveries during the quarter was the result of the company's challenges with bringing the Model 3 to overseas markets for the first time, Tesla explained in its update.

Due to a massive increase in deliveries in Europe and China, which at times exceeded 5x that of prior peak delivery levels, and many challenges encountered for the first time, we had only delivered half of the entire quarter's numbers by March 21, ten days before end of quarter. This caused a large number of vehicle deliveries to shift to the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 10,600 vehicles were in transit to customers globally.

Model S and X deliveries were far worse than expected

Tesla's Model S and X -- not the newer Model 3 -- were the primary reason for the company's shortfall in production and deliveries. Tesla produced 14,150 combined Model S and X units and delivered 12,100 of them during the quarter. This is down from 25,161 produced and 27,607 delivered in Q4.

Management had warned in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter in January that first-quarter Model S and X deliveries would be lower due to a pull-forward in demand in the U.S. as a result of the first scheduled reduction of the federal electric-vehicle tax credit for Tesla buyers on Jan. 1, 2019. But Tesla had said those deliveries would be only ""slightly below 2018 levels,"" which were at 21,815 units. Instead, Model S and X deliveries fell sharply -- both year over year and sequentially.

As this reduction of the federal electric-vehicle tax credit falls further into the past, investors should watch to see if Model S and X deliveries can return to levels seen in 2018. If they can't, Model 3 cannibalization could prove to be a real threat to the company's Model S and X sales, which have higher price tags and fatter profit margins.

Solid Model 3 deliveries

Model 3 production and deliveries actually fared well during the quarter. The company produced a record 62,950 Model 3 units, up from 61,394 in Q4. Deliveries, however, were 50,900 due to its challenges with getting vehicles to customers overseas.

Importantly, demand for Model 3 remains robust. Tesla said orders for the vehicle in the U.S. ""significantly outpaced"" Model 3 deliveries during the quarter. In addition, demand was strong enough for the company to reiterate its guidance for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries in 2019 -- up from about 245,500 deliveries in 2018."
243,0.9878,0.104,0.891,0.005,"Two notable stories surfaced during after-hours trading on Wednesday. Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced significant improvements to Autopilot, which the company said will begin rolling out to customers in the U.S. through over-the-air software updates beginning today. Meanwhile, business consulting company Resources Connection (NASDAQ:RGP) announced its third-quarter results for fiscal 2019.

Here's a look at both of these stories.

Tesla's ""more seamless"" Navigate on Autopilot

Last October, Tesla launched a feature called Navigate on Autopilot. The autopilot feature made it possible for customers to use the company's driver-assist technology from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp. But there was one requirement holding the technology back: Drivers were required to confirm automated lane changes before they were executed by using the turn stalk to approve suggested lane changes.

Tesla's April 3 update gives drivers the option to use Navigate on Autopilot without confirming lane changes.

Of course, Tesla was sure to remind customers that this doesn't mean cars are fully autonomous when on the highway.

This feature does not make a car autonomous, and lane changes will only be made when a driver's hands are detected on the wheel. As has always been the case, until truly driverless cars are validated and approved by regulators, drivers are responsible for and must remain in control of their car at all times.

The news follows Tesla's announcement this morning of an event on April 19 to discuss its progress on autonomous driving software and hardware technology.

Resources Connection earnings

Consulting firm Resources Connection announced its fiscal third-quarter results Thursday afternoon.

Revenue during the period rose 4.1% year over year to $179.5 million. The company's non- GAAP EPS was $0.20, up from $0.09 in the year-ago quarter. Growth was driven by the U.S. and Asia Pacific, where Resources Connection saw revenue rise 6% and 4% year over year, respectively. Revenue in Europe, however, took a hit, declining 9.7% year over year (3.5% in constant currency).

The results fell short of analysts' consensus estimate (via Yahoo! Finance). The average forecasts of the two analysts covering the stock were for revenue of $184.2 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21.

Resources Connection CEO Kate Duchene said the company ""faced macro headwinds"" in Europe. But she said she is ""pleased that we have made progress with our critical initiatives to improve bill rates and expand our mix of business to drive more profitable results through our solutions offerings."""
244,0.9774,0.078,0.907,0.014,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) wants to show investors the progress it has made on autonomous driving software and hardware, the company said in a press release Wednesday morning. To provide that insight into the company's autonomous vehicle development, Tesla has scheduled an event for investors later this month.

The news comes as Tesla has been releasing significant over-the-air software updates for its vehicles, including one that unlocked more driving range and improved acceleration for the long-range Model 3. CEO Elon Musk believes the sensors in its vehicles will be sufficient to eventually enable them to drive themselves. But he admits the company will need to retrofit its vehicles with a new computer, which Tesla wants to show off at its event this month.

Is Tesla's autonomous vehicle technology almost ready?

At the upcoming event, scheduled for April 19 at its headquarters in Palo Alto, California, Tesla will show off both software and hardware for autonomous driving. The event will include test drives for investors to experience the company's autopilot software, ""including features and functionality that are under active development,"" Tesla said.

The biggest news from the automaker's update on Wednesday morning, however, was that Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) computer ""is currently in production."" The new computer ""will enable full self-driving via future over-the-air software updates.""

In addition, there are ""a number of very exciting developments coming in the weeks and months ahead,"" the company said in the release.

In a series of tweets late last month, Musk said that the company's new FSD computer would be a free retrofit for anyone who paid for the full self-driving package when they bought their Tesla. ""No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed,"" Musk said in one of the tweets.

Looking for tangible progress

Of course, Tesla has been talking a big game for a while now. It was about two and a half years ago when the automaker started including sensors that the company said would eventually (after future software updates) enable autonomous driving in every vehicle it shipped. In addition, Tesla had initially planned to demonstrate one of its vehicles driving across the entire country autonomously by the end of 2017. It missed this date, and it's unclear when this drive will happen.

At the April 19 demonstration, investors should look for evidence of meaningful progress in self-driving technology.

Besides test drives of unreleased capabilities, Tesla's event later this month will feature a discussion with Musk, vice president for engineering Stuart Bowers, vice president for hardware engineering Pete Bannon, and the company's artificial intelligence chief Andrej Karpathy.

The event will be webcast, Tesla said."
245,-0.6006,0.125,0.757,0.117,"It's possible that no product innovation these days has more potential to change the way we live than driverless cars.

If autonomous vehicle (AV) technology lives up to its promise, it would mean the reimagining of the entire car experience. Self-driving pods could serve as places for office work, sleep, or entertainment as commuters travel seamlessly from one point to another.

It would also mean the end of car ownership for millions of Americans, especially those in cities. They would instead depend on ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), both of which are working toward creating their own AV fleets.

In a best-case scenario, AVs would alleviate traffic, allowing Americans to travel faster and commute from farther away, and also minimize the need for parking and parking lots. They would put millions of paid drivers out of work, but lower the costs of all kinds of goods and services that depend on truck and car transportation.

Though there are still plenty of technological challenges to overcome before driverless cars go mainstream, the biggest obstacle might not be the science. A new poll shows it's more likely to be you.

If it ain't broke...

According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll out this week, most Americans remain skeptical about driverless cars. The survey found that just 27% of respondents said they would buy a driverless car, while 64% said they would not. Also, 63% said they would not spend extra on self-driving features, and 67% said they thought driverless cars should be held to higher safety standards than their human-operated counterparts.

Those results seem to signal significant AV fear or resistance. This attitude was also evident after incidents like the pedestrian fatality caused by a self-driving Uber vehicle last year and, more recently, two Boeing 737 Max crashes that appear to be related to faulty autopilot controls. And there have been reports of vandalism against self-driving vehicles in Arizona, where they're being tested, offering further proof of a backlash. Fears of hacking into the controls of AVs have also played into some dystopian predictions.

Though car crashes are one of the most common causes of preventable death (there were more than 34,000 vehicular fatalities in the U.S. in 2017), the problem is largely an accepted one. Since most Americans believe themselves to be above-average drivers, they tend to think they won't experience a life-threatening accident.

This presents a distinct challenge for companies like Uber, Lyft, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Waymo, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and others racing to disrupt the traditional auto market with driverless vehicles.

No, really, it's safe

No company is further along on driverless cars than Waymo, the AV unit of Google parent Alphabet. The search giant launched its AV project in 2009 with the goal of saving lives. Today, its vehicles have racked up more than 10 million miles on public roads, and the company launched a ""robot taxi"" service in metro Phoenix called Waymo One last December, the first paid service of its kind. Waymo plans to gradually expand the service to new cities.

Along the way, Waymo has been aware of AV resistance but has made efforts to respond. In 2017, it launched a public education campaign in partnership with organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the National Safety Council to convince consumers of the benefits of driverless cars, explaining how they would help eliminate problems like drunk and distracted driving.

Last year, Waymo released a video that showed how its technology had avoided collisions. In one example, a Waymo vehicle stopped before an intersection to avoid a crash with another car that had gone through a red light, preventing an accident that might have happened if a human driver was behind the wheel.

By comparison, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has at times been problematic with his advocacy for self-driving vehicles. Teslas have partly self-driving capabilities, and some drivers have gotten into fatal accidents while the autopilot was engaged, leading to criticism that drivers believe the autopilot to be more advanced than it is. Days after a fatal Tesla crash a year ago, the company said in a statement that its autopilot ""unequivocally makes the world safer,"" though it did apologize to the victim's family.

Uber, on the other hand, considered selling its AV unit after one of its vehicles killed a pedestrian, and has since downplayed its driverless-car initiative, wary of the outcry that followed the pedestrian fatality.

Finally, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has called on the federal government to pass legislation to encourage the safe innovation and deployment of self-driving vehicles, noting that 94% of traffic accidents are caused by human error.

The next steps

Disruptive technologies often encounter resistance. Many balked initially at sharing-economy pioneers like Airbnb and Uber, whose businesses relied on strangers trusting strangers with their homes or taxi rides. A few years later, those concepts are now widely accepted, and both businesses are growing rapidly.

Still, driverless cars present a unique challenge because of the safety risk. If the technology works flawlessly, AVs should be much safer than traditional cars. But consumers will have to be convinced that the tech capability is there before they entrust their lives to algorithms and robot taxis.

Even Waymo may have to rethink its operations as nearly 40% of Waymo One riders have registered complaints about the service, according to tech news site The Information. It found, among other issues, that the human backup driver had to take over to avoid collisions on occasion.

Whether or when fully autonomous technology is ready for mass deployment remains an open question. In the meantime, it's up to pioneers like Waymo and Tesla to convince consumers that having control of one's own vehicle can create an illusion of safety, and that, comparatively, AVs will be safer (if they aren't already).

If the country is going to embrace autonomous vehicles, the companies creating them and the cities where they operate may need to get together and rethink the entire road transportation system to really change the way we live today."
246,0.9967,0.145,0.805,0.05,"The battle lines over the future of Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) are fought daily among traders, institutional investors, and investment bank analysts.

The spectrum of views run from ""the most revolutionary energy company ever"" to an unsustainable dream built on cheap, and soon to be crushing, debt loads.

I'm not here to take a side in this war of words and wealth today, but to share the single metric that has recently made TSLA a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell.

So we not only produce a consensus EPS estimate (that is also weighted by the most accurate analysts and most recent revisions), but we also pit over 4,000 stocks against each other to determine the relative strength and direction of those revisions.

I like to call it a ""bell curve cage match"" because we end up with thousands of stocks distributed accordingly:

The top 5% of upward EPS revisions earn a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) rating.

The next 15% of upward EPS revisions merit the Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) rating.

The middle 60% of stocks earn the Zacks #3 Rank ""neutral"" rating because the magnitude and/or agreement of recent revisions was of low impact for investors.

Below this average group, the downward EPS revisions start to stand out in terms of magnitude and agreement, with the bottom 20% of stocks earning either a Zacks #4 Rank or #5 Rank (bottom 5%).

And that's where TSLA finds itself today in the dungeon of the Zacks Rank because the recent downward EPS revisions by analysts were worse than 95% of all other stocks. Here's the current view from the Zacks Detailed Estimates Page...

You can see above that in the past 60 days (the key window for the Zacks Rank calculation), the majority of 8 covering analysts for who we have EPS revisions have all lowered their profit estimates to drive the consensus down from $6.42 to $6.14 for the current year.

Now that's only a 4.4% drop, so the magnitude wasn't big. But the agreement among analysts definitely was significant.

Beyond Agreement and Magnitude, though, are two other quantitative factors in the Zacks Rank algorithm: Upside potential based on the most accurate (or most recent) revisions and Surprise history. Both of these also come up negative for TSLA earnings momentum...

Note that for the current year, one analyst is far more bearish that the crowd with his or her EPS estimate of $4.81 for 2019, implying a potential 21.7% negative surprise.

And regarding actual historical surprises, we see that despite making a big swing to profitability last year, Tesla delivered an earnings miss of 7.2% in Q4. Upside and surprises have smaller weightings in the Zacks Rank algorithm, but they do have an impact relative to their base effects.

Bottom line: Traders can have any fundamental or technical view they wish about TSLA shares, but they will always do better by adding a consistent and unemotional quantitative metric used by institutional investors around the globe. The ranking of stocks by earnings estimate revisions produces a key relative strength metric -- the Zacks Rank -- that gets you on the right side of short-term EPS momentum, up or down.

The stock ended the trading day up more than 3%. Bullishness likely reflects a combination of optimistic commentary from an analyst and bets from some investors that the market is underestimating the automaker's first-quarter deliveries.

This analyst sees 55% upside

Following a visit to Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, where the electric-car maker builds all of its electric vehicles, Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer was optimistic, citing the compelling value proposition of the company's recently released standard-battery Model 3, which starts at $35,000.

""With the performance of a 911 and the price of an Audi A4 or BMW 3 series, we see the Model 3 as the best value proposition currently on the market today,"" said Dorsheimer (via Barron's).

The analyst reiterated a buy rating and a $450 12-month price target for the stock.

How many vehicles did Tesla deliver?

Meanwhile, investors are waiting for an update on Tesla's first-quarter vehicle deliveries. With the first quarter falling amid the company's aggressive ramp-up in Model 3 production and Tesla's global expansion of Model 3 deliveries, it's difficult to gauge how many vehicles were delivered during the quarter.

Analysts, on average, expect Tesla to deliver 74,900 vehicles during the quarter, with about 20,000 of those vehicles being Model S and X units and the remaining being Model 3.

But uncertainty looms. Price cuts during the quarter and the introduction of a revised referral program have prompted questions about demand. In addition, foreseeing the challenges associated with a global expansion to Asia and Europe during the quarter, Tesla had said it expected to end the period with around 10,000 vehicles in transit to customers. It's also hard to predict how the U.S. electric vehicle federal tax credit's reduction for Tesla vehicle purchases at the beginning of the year will impact demand.

Musk seems satisfied

Whether investors will be happy or not with Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers is still to be determined. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk seems satisfied.

""Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe & China!"" Musk tweeted on the last day of the month. ""Most insane logistics challenge I've ever seen. Thanks also to many country & city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated.""

This tweet follows a leaked email from Tesla senior vice president Sanjay Shah in mid-March, calling for department heads to find as many volunteers as possible to help with deliveries.

""We have to deliver 30,000 more cars in next 15 days,"" wrote Shah in the email, according to Business Insider.

Based on Dorseheimer's optimism for the Model 3, production and logistics -- not demand -- will likely be Tesla's primary bottleneck (if there is one) when it comes to 2019 deliveries of the vehicle. Investors will likely get a better insight into how deliveries and demand are faring for the new vehicle when the electric-car company provides an update on vehicle deliveries."
248,0.9127,0.085,0.845,0.07,"With Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) set to report its first-quarter deliveries sometime between April 1 and April 3, investors will be watching the update closely. Not only will it give investors insight into how the company's important Model 3 production-ramp up and global expansion initiatives are faring, but the automaker sometimes uses the update to reveal other views into its business. For instance, in the past, Tesla has talked about demand, vehicle order trends, and even forecasts for order trends.

Going into Tesla's first-quarter vehicle delivery update, investors should look not just for the number of vehicles delivered, but also for an update on order trends for the Model 3. Is demand on the upswing after the launch of Tesla's long-awaited $35,000 Model 3?

Whether or not the release of Tesla's most affordable vehicle helped demand or not may be the most important thing to look for in electric-car maker's update.

Why it matters

Ever since Tesla garnered around 400,000 reservations for the Model 3 within a few months of its initial unveiling, the company has had high expectations for the vehicle's sales potential. Management's big expectations are best summed up in comments from CEO Elon Musk in the company's most recent earnings call: ""[M]y best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide is something -- in a strong economy, it's something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year. ... But I think even in a recession, worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3.""

Tesla's recent quarterly delivery volumes bode well for the Model 3's potential. The company averaged about 60,000 quarterly Model 3 deliveries in its last two quarters. This was notably before introducing the lower-cost $35,000 version of the Model 3 and before expanding to Europe and Asia.

But Tesla still hasn't proved it can generate annual demand for Model 3 at volumes above 500,000 per year.

Investors, therefore, should look for Tesla to explain how the introduction of the $35,000 Model 3 and the company's expansion to new markets has impacted demand for the important vehicle. If Tesla says that the launch of the lower-cost Model 3 and its global expansion are driving a significant increase in order volumes, then Musk's optimistic outlook for Model 3's demand potential will be more believable.

Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Tesla.

Reasons to worry

The electric-car maker has given investors some reasons to doubt whether demand for the vehicle is living up to management's expectations. For instance, before the standard-battery $35,000 Model 3 was launched, pricier versions of the vehicle were hit with several price cuts. Further, Tesla recently brought back a revised version of its referral program.

Of course, it's always possible that Tesla has simply been able to ramp-up Model 3 production at a faster rate than expected, prompting the company to pull a few demand levers.

Hopefully, we'll have a better idea next week whether investors should worry about demand."
249,0.3281,0.036,0.937,0.027,"Electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is slated to report its first-quarter vehicle deliveries next week, as the automaker typically provides an update on deliveries and production three days after each quarter ends -- and Tesla's first quarter will come to a close this weekend.

It's fair to say that this is a wildcard quarter for the company. An expected increase in Model 3 production and the company's global expansion during the quarter makes pinpointing a reasonable forecast for vehicle deliveries extremely difficult.

Higher production

Based on what Tesla said in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter about its expectations for production and deliveries in Q1 and the rest of the year, total production for the quarter should be slightly higher than Q4.

""Model 3 production volumes in Fremont should gradually continue to grow throughout 2019 and reach a sustained rate of 7,000 units per week by the end of the year,"" Tesla said in its fourth-quarter update. While this confirms Tesla's expectation for production to rise, the company was already producing Model 3s at a weekly rate around 5,000 units per week when it entered Q1, so a gradual increase throughout the quarter toward Tesla's year-end target for 7,000 units per week could make a meaningful, though not huge, difference in Tesla's first-quarter deliveries versus Q4's.

With 61,394 Model 3 vehicles produced in Q4, a slightly higher production rate could yield around 67,000 to 71,000 more Model 3 units in Q1.

Meanwhile, given Tesla's expectations for weaker demand for the Model S and X in the first quarter of 2019 because of the reduction of the federal electric-vehicle tax credit on the first of the year, it's likely that the automaker reduced production of the two vehicles. With 25,161 of Model S and X units combined produced in Q4, first-quarter production for the two vehicles will probably be closer to 20,000 units.

These forecasts translate to a total vehicle production estimate between 87,000 and 91,000 units, higher than Tesla's total vehicle production of 86,555 units in Q4.

Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Tesla.

Lower deliveries

Deliveries, however, will probably be much lower than production, as Tesla said it expected to end the quarter with 10,000 units in transit to customers as the company expands overseas. That compares with 2,907 vehicles in transit to customers at the end of Q4.

Subtracting 10,000 from a production forecast of 87,000 to 91,000 units equals an estimate for 77,000 to 81,000 vehicle deliveries. As it turns out, analysts may be using a similar logic for their own estimates; the consensus estimate for Tesla's total vehicle deliveries in Q1 is about 78,000 units, down from about 91,000 units in the fourth quarter of 2018.

It's worth noting that whether Tesla grows its vehicle deliveries sequentially or not, the company is still growing its business at a staggering rate on a year-over-year basis. Tesla delivered less than 30,000 vehicles in the first-quarter of 2018.

Look for an update from Tesla on its first-quarter deliveries sometime between April 1 and April 3."
250,0.9942,0.075,0.893,0.032,"It was going to be the biggest unveiling in the history of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)! The company's new Model Y crossover SUV was set to have iconic gull-wing doors and a price tag under $40,000! And on March 14, the big reveal came, and the car...had neither of those things (at least, not yet).

Perhaps it was disappointment by legions of gull-wing door fans or maybe impatience that no deliveries would begin for a year and a half, but the stock market sent Tesla's shares down about 5% in the wake of the announcement, to their lowest level all year. But here's why Tesla fans -- and skeptics -- shouldn't worry too much about the Model Y (at least, not yet).

1. It's a lot like the Model 3

The Model Y follows the classic formula of a crossover SUV: A manufacturer takes the frame of one of its sedans that's already in production -- in this case, the Model 3 -- and alters the design just enough to put an SUV body on the sedan frame.

In the case of the Model Y, though, it really looks like a Model 3 with a hatchback. The Model Y will boast some additional cargo room, and will borrow the Model X's additional back row of fold-up jump seats, allowing the car to seat up to seven. The trade-off is a slightly shorter range. It will share about 75% of its parts with the Model 3.

On the one hand, this should help the Model Y have a smooth(er) rollout: With Tesla having already solved many of the headaches it experienced ramping up Model 3 production at its Gigafactory -- where the Model Y is also slated to be produced -- it should be comparatively simple to make small adjustments to the production line and turn it loose.

On the other hand, with the cars so much alike, won't Model Y sales simply eat into the sales of the existing Model 3?

2. Crossover SUVs sell, but...

Honestly, I'm probably the perfect target market for the Model Y. I currently drive a Toyota Prius, but now that my kids are getting older, I could use more cargo room and an extra row of seats for when Grandma wants to come along to the taekwondo tournament or the ballet recital. I've been following Tesla for a while, and a generous friend let me take the wheel of his Model 3 a few weeks ago (thanks, Mike!) and I thought it was fun to drive.

So I'd consider buying a Model Y, and there are probably a lot of folks like me out there. According to data by J.D. Power, about half of new car sales are SUVs or crossovers. And there are limited options for fuel-efficient versions of larger passenger vehicles. For example, there's only one hybrid minivan available in the U.S. right now (the Chrysler Pacifica). This means the potential market for the Model Y should be huge.

But the price tag of the premium versions of the Model Y, which are slated to come off the assembly line in late 2020, will be between $47,000 and $60,000. That puts the vehicle out of reach for many potential Model Y customers (myself included). The $39,000 version of the Model Y isn't going to be available until at least 2021, so sales until then will likely be limited. And keep in mind that Tesla has a very spotty record when it comes to delivery dates, so it's not unreasonable to think that the base price Model Y might not be available for three years or more.

In the meantime, you can bet Tesla's competitors are going to be rolling out their own crossover SUVs, possibly in hybrid or electric versions. Just four days after Tesla's announcement, Fisker announced it would also offer a $40,000 electric SUV by 2021. Or you could get that Chrysler Pacifica hybrid today for about the same price as the base Model Y -- definitely not as cool, but at least it's available.

3. Bigger fish to fry

In his rollout of the Model Y, CEO Elon Musk didn't spend a whole lot of time talking about the car. Instead, he went on at length about the manufacturing struggles the company has faced in recent years. This echoed comments he made in a January letter to employees that ""the road ahead is very difficult."" The company recently backtracked on an announcement that it would close most of its Tesla stores to help keep vehicle costs down. The company's much-heralded solar roof seems to be mired in technical issues keeping it from being widely available.

While Tesla has managed to turn a profit in the last two consecutive quarters -- a first for the company -- its margins may be about to suffer as the lower-priced base version of the Model 3 becomes more widely available. All of this is occurring independently of the Model Y's rollout, and has a lot more bearing on Tesla's investment thesis than the Model Y does.

Investor takeaway

Musk predicts that Tesla will sell 1 million Model Ys, and that's probably not farfetched. But what's unclear is how long will it take to get production started and then ramped up, how much the Model Y will eat into sales of the higher-priced Model X and comparably priced Model 3, and what competitors and a fast-evolving automotive landscape will do in the meantime. Oh, and the little matter of whether Tesla can actually turn a sustained profit as it moves toward more lower-priced automobile offerings.

Simply put, the Model Y isn't necessarily going to be a game-changer for Tesla. And even if it is, we won't know for at least a couple of years. So, resist the urge to buy or sell the company based on this news."
251,0.9823,0.073,0.881,0.046,"At first glance, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) might seem to be on a roll. The electric vehicle pioneer posted a huge jump in deliveries last year, as production of its Model 3 sedan ramped up. Yet there have been growing signs of trouble at Tesla in the past few months. Most significantly, the Model 3 order backlog appears to be shrinking quickly, as evidenced by a drop in wait times for new orders and the recent introduction of the long-awaited $35,000 base model.

Against that backdrop, Tesla unveiled its next new model last week: the Model Y crossover. The Model Y will be Tesla's first foray into the compact/midsize crossover space, the hottest segment in the auto market. Thus, the vehicle could become extremely popular. However, it won't be available for at least a year and a half -- and now that car buyers know it's coming, Tesla could struggle to sell the vehicles it is building today.

Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Tesla.

The Model Y could be quite popular

Tesla CEO Elon Musk expects the Model Y to be the company's best-selling vehicle. Most analysts agree. In recent years, sales of sedans and hatchbacks have plunged in the U.S. and most of the world, as more car buyers have opted for the greater comfort and cargo space offered by crossovers and SUVs.

Thus far, Tesla's results don't fully fit this trend. In recent quarters, global deliveries of Tesla's Model S sedan and Model X SUV have been roughly equal.

That said, the Model S is extremely large. It even has optional rear-facing seats suitable for two children, nominally allowing it to seat seven people. By contrast, buyers who are comparing the Model Y to the smaller Model 3 sedan may opt for the crossover in far greater numbers, to take advantage of its extra space. That creates a potentially serious near-term problem for Tesla.

Will Model 3 sales hold up?

The Model Y will have a starting price of $39,000, just $4,000 more than the Model 3. And while Model 3 prices have been a moving target recently, it appears that upgraded versions of the Model Y will cost about 10% more than comparable versions of the Model 3.

That's a modest premium for a vehicle that has at least 50% more cargo space -- and can seat seven in a pinch, for buyers who pay an extra $3,000 for a third row. This raises the question of whether the Model Y will cannibalize demand for the Model 3.

Musk doesn't seem to think so. On Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call, he estimated that steady-state global demand for the Model 3 would be around 700,000 to 800,000 units a year in a strong economy. With Tesla only expecting to build around 300,000 Model 3s this year, Musk's comments imply that capacity -- not demand -- would be the main constraint on sales, at least until Tesla's new factory in China gets up and running.

That said, Musk's confidence doesn't seem to be founded on actual order activity. During the earnings call, he mentioned that January and February tend to be slow months for auto sales. He also noted that the phase-out schedule for federal electric vehicle tax credits pulled some demand forward into late 2018. Thus, Musk expected Model 3 sales to rebound around now.

The Model Y announcement could cause many would-be Model 3 buyers to reconsider which Tesla is right for them. In the short term, the continuing availability of a $3,750 federal tax credit (through June) may bolster demand in the U.S. But based on the apparent slowdown in Model 3 orders in recent months, Tesla's current Model 3 production rate appears to be unsustainable.

Navigating perilous waters

Tesla ended 2018 with $3.7 billion of unrestricted cash. However, the company expected to burn cash in the first quarter, due to the timing and mix of deliveries. Furthermore, it recently repaid $920 million of convertible notes with cash.

Thus, Tesla's cash cushion has shrunk significantly since the beginning of 2019. Management hasn't been worried because it has been confident that Tesla would produce positive free cash flow for the rest of the year. But between the federal tax credit falling by 50% again at midyear, the introduction of the low-margin $35,000 Model 3, and a potential need to offset slumping demand with price cuts, incentives, or production cutbacks, Tesla is likely to continue burning cash beyond this quarter.

If the Model Y launch creates a significant air pocket in Model 3 demand, Tesla could face a cash crunch. Depending on how much cash it ends up burning, the company could have trouble raising capital if it proves necessary. That could decimate Tesla stock -- even if the Model Y ultimately becomes a big success.

Furthermore, a slowdown in demand this year could erode Tesla's brand halo. In the long run, that may be an even bigger threat to the company. A ton of competition is coming to the electric vehicle market, particularly in the crossover segment. If Tesla loses its cachet over the next year and a half due to falling sales, even the coming of the Model Y may not be enough to save it."
252,0.9485,0.082,0.886,0.032,"Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is asking workers to help find more volunteers to deliver 30,000 vehicles during the last two weeks of the quarter, according to Business Insider. The quarter-end push comes as the company has been ramping up production and deliveries of its Model 3 as Tesla begins selling the vehicle in more markets.

A request for volunteers coincides with the company's aggressive efforts recently to cut costs as it aims to become sustainably profitable. But the high number of vehicles Tesla reportedly needs to deliver in a short period of time raises questions about whether the company will be able to pull it off.

Tesla needs to deliver 30,000 vehicles

""We need your help to make more progress in volunteer sign ups,"" wrote Sanjay Shah, Tesla's senior vice president, in a company email on Friday to department heads, according to Business Insider. ""We have to deliver 30,000 more cars in next 15 days.""

A quarter-end crunch to get vehicles out the door isn't a new practice for Tesla. Toward the end of its third quarter of 2018, the company invited Tesla owners to help educate new customers as deliveries rose to record levels. During Tesla's fourth quarter, the electric-car maker even purchased some trucking companies to avoid a trucking shortage as quarter-end deliveries ramped up.

Tesla delivered about 91,000 vehicles in its entire fourth quarter of 2018. Squeezing 30,000 deliveries into 15 days, therefore, would require a herculean effort.

Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Tesla.

Growing pains

Tesla's production and deliveries have skyrocketed recently as the company's new Model 3 finally stabilizes at mass-market production levels. Trailing-12-month vehicle deliveries are up 138% year over year for Tesla, with about 71% of those deliveries taking place in the last two quarters. Building a network to support significantly higher volumes of deliveries has come with some challenges, particularly since Tesla is simultaneously trying to cut costs to boost profitability.

As 2019 unfolds, investors should watch to see whether Tesla takes steps to spread out deliveries more evenly throughout its quarters, reducing its dependence on volunteers and intense quarter-end activity. Unless Tesla can add to its delivery team throughout the year, challenges may persist. The automaker expects a huge jump in deliveries, with management guiding for total 2019 deliveries of 360,000 to 400,000. That implies 45% to 65% year-over-year growth."
253,0.8555,0.036,0.956,0.009,"Late Thursday night, electric-car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its follow-up act to its Model 3. The company pulled the curtains back on its Model Y sport-utility vehicle -- a midsize SUV priced similarly to its mass-market Model 3 sedan.

While deliveries of the new vehicle won't start for over a year, the Model Y is an important step in Tesla's plan to bring compelling, fully electric cars to the masses. Before the company's mid-2017 launch of its Model 3, Tesla's vehicles were too expensive for most consumers. But the Model 3 -- and now the Model Y -- encapsulate the company's concerted effort to make its vehicles more accessible to a larger customer base.

Model Y: The specs

Starting at $39,000 for the standard range version of the vehicle, the Model Y is about 11% more expensive than the Model 3. A price difference that makes sense since the SUV is about 10% larger than the Model 3.

Don't expect deliveries anytime soon though. Tesla doesn't plan to start shipping Model Y units until fall of next year -- and initial deliveries will be high-end variants only, including performance, long-range, and dual-motor versions. These versions start at $60,000, $47,000, and $51,000, respectively. The standard-range Model Y for $39,000 won't start shipping until spring of 2021.

Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Tesla.

The vehicle comes in two seat configurations: Five or seven seats. But customers will have to pay an extra $3,000 to get the seven-seat configuration. And the seven-seat setup won't be available until 2020.

In typical Tesla fashion, all of the Model Y variants boast wild acceleration times, ranging from a zero-to-60 mph time of 5.9 seconds for the standard-range version and a 3.5 second time for the performance version.

Big expectations

A Model Y fills a missing spot in Tesla's vehicle lineup. When Tesla's luxury Model S sedan was the company's only vehicle in production, the launch of its Model X -- Tesla's full-size SUV -- essentially doubled the company's addressable market and doubled annual sales volume. But the lower-cost Model 3 sedan currently doesn't have a counterpart the way the Model S does. The Model Y will fill that void, giving Tesla's business a key catalyst.

With midsize sedans outselling cars in many of the world's top auto markets, it's safe to say that the Model Y could rival or even surpass Model 3 sales volume. And with Model 3 accounting for about 70% of the company's 91,000 vehicle deliveries in Q4, the sport-utility vehicle may provide a substantial lift to Tesla's overall vehicle sales volume."

Wall Street shrugs at Tesla's Model Y

Shares of Tesla declined 5% after the electric vehicle maker left analysts underwhelmed with last night's reveal of its new Model Y crossover SUV.

Around 10% larger than its Model 3 sedan, the Model Y will be priced between $39,000 and $60,000 (depending on your desired range and options), will accelerate from 0 to 60 in as little as 3.5 seconds, and comes with 66 cubic feet of storage space. CEO Elon Musk also boasted the Model Y was designed to be the world's safest midsize SUV, with deliveries for higher-end models expected to begin in fall 2020, followed by the lower-cost standard range version in spring 2021.

The problem? The planned event held no surprises for astute industry watchers. Worse yet, the long delivery time frame does little to ease investors' concerns over steadily increasing competition in the electric vehicle space.

Noodles & Company goes cold

Noodles & Company stock plunged 13.8% after the fast-casual restaurant chain announced disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results.

Quarterly revenue rose 0.4% to $113.2 million, as a 4% increase in comparable-restaurant sales was partly offset by the impact of restaurant closures over the past year. That translated into adjusted net income of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, roughly flat from the year-ago period on a per-share basis. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $0.03 per share on slightly higher revenue of $113.8 million.

But CEO Dave Boennighausen called it a ""strong"" quarter, arguing the company's positive comparable sales are ""further evidence that our strategic initiatives are working.""

""We have maintained momentum into 2019,"" added Executive Chairman Paul Murphy, ""with our initiatives continuing to drive positive comparable sales despite the historically severe weather that has hampered the majority of our major markets.""

As such, Noodles & Company expects 2019 revenue of $462 million to $470 million, comparable-sales growth of 2% to 4%, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.06 to $0.15. Most analysts were modeling 2019 earnings of $0.13 per share on revenue of roughly $464 million."

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tumbled on Friday, falling as much as 5.2%. As of 2:13 p.m. EDT, the stock was down about 4.7%.

The stock's decline comes after the company's announcement of its all-electric Model Y sport-utility vehicle, the company's lowest-priced SUV yet. Some investors may be disappointed with the fact that there weren't any notable surprises at the event.

So what

As expected, Tesla's Model Y was a smaller and more affordable SUV than the company's pricey Model X. With a starting price of $39,000, the vehicle is positioned to be a counterpart to the Model 3, which starts at $35,000. The vehicle also steals heavily from the Model 3's design, which was also expected, since Tesla has said the Model Y would be built on the Model 3 platform and share about 75% of its components with the vehicle.

Without any surprise announcements, such as unexpected features, an earlier-than-expected production schedule, or updates to current models, some investors may be underwhelmed. Tesla has made surprise announcements at events before, including the unveiling of its revamped Roadster during its Tesla Semi event.

Now what

Just as Tesla did with the Model 3, the company will initially only deliver more expensive versions of the Model Y. Tesla is expected to begin delivering the Model Y performance, long-range rear-wheel-drive, and all-wheel-driveversions in fall of next year while starting deliveries of its standard-range $39,000 vehicle in spring of 2021."

Facebook deals with outage, investigation

Shares of Facebook dropped 2% as the social media giant handled new problems on a couple of fronts. First, the service encountered serious problems throughout much of the day on Wednesday, raising questions about Facebook's ability to handle current traffic levels. At the same time, an investigation from federal prosecutors appears to be the latest in a series of legal and regulatory issues that the social media company has encountered lately.

Facebook's outages continued across parts of its network on Thursday, with users complaining that problems for Instagram, WhatsApp, and the namesake Facebook app kept them from getting consistent access. The company's tech problems covered several parts of the world, including portions of the U.S., Europe, and South America. The episode highlighted both the demand that customers still have for the service as well as the challenges of keeping the platform up and running.

Meanwhile, investigators are looking at Facebook's agreements with fellow technology companies to share personal information and data, with an eye toward revealing whether those agreements violated the privacy rights of users. Facebook has already had to pay fines related to its data practices, but this latest development could prove even more serious for the company and its investors.

Tesla readies another SUV

Tesla shares were up less than 1% Thursday morning, just hours ahead of the much-anticipated unveiling of the Model Y electric sport utility vehicle. Investors have anxiously looked forward to Tesla's newest SUV offering, because the vehicle class has gained a lot of traction both in the U.S. market and abroad. Tesla does already offer its Model X SUV, but just as the Model 3 sedan gave Tesla a lower price point for customers interested in regular cars, the Model Y should be less expensive than the Model X and be aimed at the mass auto market.

There haven't been a lot of details about the Model Y, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested that the SUV would be about 10% more expensive than a Model 3 while having slightly less range for a comparable battery system. That implies a Model Y price of $38,500, based on the latest price reduction to $35,000 for the Model 3. What investors hope is that production of the Model Y will be able to gain a lot of synergy from Model 3 production, with Tesla using many of the same parts and components in building both vehicles.

One thing the Model Y event should do is draw some attention away from Musk's ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has flared up recently in light of . Shareholders would prefer to see a nice pop for the stock as well, which has lost ground in 2019 amid broader fears about the business."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week that the company would unveil the vehicle on March 14, a day earlier than a date the CEO provided investors in May of last year.

Tesla impressively expects Model Y production and demand to trend higher than the Model 3 -- and the Model 3 is the electric-car maker's highest-volume vehicle yet. Investors, therefore, will be watching the event closely.

Tesla's Model Y unveiling

""Model Y unveil event on March 14 at LA Design Studio,"" Musk announced on Twitter last week. On the company's website, Tesla says it will livestream the unveiling at 8 p.m. PDT.

Ahead of the event, details are scant. But Musk did provide a few tidbits in a tweet last week. ""Model Y, being an SUV, is about 10% bigger than Model 3, so will cost about 10% more & have slightly less range for same battery,"" the CEO said.

In other words, this will be meaningfully smaller and cheaper than Tesla's current SUV: the Model X.

With the Model 3 priced at $35,000, the Model Y's starting price will likely be about $38,500. But Tesla will likely introduce higher-priced versions of the vehicle before it brings to market the base model, just as it did with the Model 3.

Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Tesla.

Can the Model Y live up to the hype?

Tesla has enormous expectations for its Model Y. Citing the fact that the midsized SUV segment is the most popular vehicle type in many of the major markets Tesla operates in, Musk believes the Model Y will be produced in higher volumes than the Model 3, he said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.

In addition, Musk expects significant synergies from building the Model Y on the Model 3 platform. ""Since Model Y will be built on the Model 3 platform and is designed to share about 75% of its components with Model 3,"" Tesla explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter, ""the cost of the Model Y production line should be substantially lower than the Model 3 line in Fremont, and the production ramp should also be faster.""

In the meantime, investors still have doubts about Tesla's ability to increase Model 3 production and demand to its target 500,000-units-per-year level. Recent price cuts have prompted concerns about demand for Tesla's vehicles. While the electric-car maker has always planned to lower Model 3 prices in order to hit its target $35,000 starting price for the vehicle, aggressive price cuts to all of its models and a workforce reduction announced earlier this year have some investors worried that demand isn't living up to the company's expectations.

As of Tesla's last update on its timeline for the Model Y, the company wants to bring the vehicle to market in low volumes early next year and hit volume production by the end of next year.

Tune in to the event on Tesla's website on Thursday to find out details about the new vehicle."
258,-0.938,0.042,0.89,0.068,"Even at the best of times, Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) operations have seemed like loosely organized chaos. But while the electric-vehicle pioneer repeatedly missed deadlines, it was hard to argue with the long-term results. Tesla went from delivering a little over 22,000 vehicles in 2013 to more than 245,000 in 2018. By the end of that period, it had also reached profitability -- albeit with the help of various gimmicks to boost the mix of Model 3 sedans toward pricier (i.e., more lucrative) versions.

By contrast, Tesla's recent behavior is more concerning. In particular, the company's rapid-fire price changes for its vehicles and its hastily announced -- and subsequently reversed -- decision to close most of its stores are signs of a business that has been stressed to the breaking point.

Price changes continue

It's becoming difficult to count the number of times Tesla has adjusted its prices in the past six months. In October, the company launched a cheaper version of the Model 3 with a mid-range battery, at a starting price of $45,000. Less than a week later, it raised the price by $1,000.

The changes have accelerated since the beginning of 2019. In January, Tesla cut the prices of all of its vehicles by $2,000 in the U.S., to partially offset the phase-out of the federal tax credit for Tesla buyers. (Around the same time, it also stopped taking orders for the smaller-battery versions of the Model S and Model X.) Tesla cut Model 3 prices by another $1,100 in early February.

The biggest change came on Feb. 28, when Tesla announced that it would start taking orders for the long-awaited $35,000 version of the Model 3. At that time, it slashed the prices on all of its other models by an average of 6%. Some premium versions of the Model S and Model X were marked down by as much as $18,000. Yet these price cuts announced less than two weeks ago were partially reversed on Sunday. Tesla will raise prices by an average of 3% worldwide next week.

Changing prices this frequently is virtually guaranteed to alienate customers, especially those who recently paid more for their vehicles. The frequency of these price cuts could also dampen demand, if potential customers start to expect prices to keep falling.

Thus, it's hard to come up with a positive interpretation of these developments. The most likely explanation is that Tesla sales have slowed dramatically and the company is desperately casting about for ways to reverse the trend. Plunging wait times for new orders, analysts' channel checks, and data regarding sales in Europe all seem to confirm this explanation.

Tesla stores are closing -- or are they?

An equally bizarre reversal regarding store closures also played out in the past two weeks. In conjunction with the Feb. 28 Model 3 announcement, Tesla announced that it would close nearly all of its stores and galleries to cut costs and make it possible to offer lower prices.

There was just one problem: Tesla is locked into long-term leases for most of its 106 U.S. stores. At an investor conference last week, Taubman Centers (NYSE:TCO) CEO Robert Taubman declared that Tesla would have to pay huge termination fees to back out of its leases. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla was on the hook for $1.6 billion of future lease payments.

That number is misleading, as it includes millions of square feet of production, administration, and warehouse space. Still, the rent Tesla owes for its retail spaces is significant. For example, it has eight stores at Taubman's roughly two dozen properties, which command an average base rent of more than $60 per square foot. Including expense reimbursements and percentage rent, Taubman Centers' average rent is well over $100 per square foot -- and significantly more at the best malls, where Tesla stores are heavily concentrated. Thus, the total lease liabilities for Tesla's U.S. stores alone could easily run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Tesla should have recognized that it couldn't just walk away from these leases, but that seems to have been the original plan, more or less. On Sunday, it reversed course, indicating that it would close 10% of its stores immediately, with another 20% under review for possible closure in the coming months. Tesla said this was why it has to raise prices by 3% next week.

Sloppy decision-making

It's hard to avoid the impression that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's frenetic leadership style is no longer working. He's not inspiring customers to order Model 3s in droves, he's not inspiring loyalty among his subordinates -- at least not in the leadership ranks -- and he's not making good business decisions, as evidenced by the fact that he keeps changing them abruptly.

Maybe Musk's overloaded schedule is finally catching up to him. Maybe the SEC's scrutiny is taking a toll on him. It's hard to know. But now, what once seemed thoroughly implausible -- that Musk could be a liability to Tesla, rather than an asset -- now seems entirely possible.

Until Tesla can deliver several quarters of steady results to prove that production costs and demand are both meeting expectations, investors should steer clear of Tesla stock."

Tesla pumps the brakes on store closures

Shares of Tesla climbed 2.4% after the electric vehicle maker revealed in a Sunday blog post it has ""decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months.""

For perspective, Tesla announced plans last month to wind down the vast majority of its stores as part of a strategic shift toward online-only sales -- a move the company said would enable it to ""pass the savings along to our customers.""

Given its about-face this weekend, however, Tesla now says it will ""need"" to increase vehicle prices by roughly 3% on average worldwide.

""In other words, we will only close about half as many stores,"" the company elaborated, ""but the cost savings are therefore only about half.""

Tesla was quick to point out its recently launched $35,000 Model 3 sedan will be spared from the price bumps. Instead, the increases will be limited to its Model S, Model X, and more expensive Model 3 versions.

In any case, it seems the market approves of this latest strategic shift.

Boeing stock falls sharply in wake of aircraft tragedy

Shares of Boeing plunged as much as 13.5%, but recouped some of their early losses to close down 5.3% after one of the aircraft specialist's new 737 Max 8 planes crashed near Addis Ababa. There were no survivors among the 157 people on board the Ethiopian Airlines flight.

The crash is the second fatal incident in five months involving Boeing's new single-aisle plane; another 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air crashed in Indonesia last October, killing all 181 passengers.

On the heels of this weekend's events, countries including Ethiopia, China, and Indonesia have each ordered their respective airlines to ground the planes pending further investigation.

""Safety is our No. 1 priority and we are taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this incident, working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved,"" Boeing wrote in a statement."

Nick Sciple: Folks, just wanted to let you know before you dive into this episode, this episode ended up running a little bit longer than we expected, talking about Tesla. Obviously, there's been so much in the news the past week and over the past few months as well. As quick as the news cycle is with this company, we really wanted to cover everything that's going on with the business so we didn't have to drop three Tesla podcasts over the next couple of months. Keep that in mind as you tune into this episode. Hope you enjoy my conversation with John Rosevear. Thanks!

Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today's Thursday, March 7, and we're talking Tesla. I'm your host, Nick Sciple, and today I'm joined by Motley Fool senior auto analyst John Rosevear via Skype. How are you doing, John?

John Rosevear: I'm doing very well, Nick! How are you?

Sciple: I am doing great and I am very excited to talk about Tesla today! This is a company that has been in the news so much in the past year, but in the past month especially. We've got confusion around European deliveries, issues on imports into China. You have the general counsel and the CFO leaving in the past few months. Elon Musk just got contempt charges from the SEC. And now, there's price cuts across their entire lineup of vehicles. And, they announced the Model Y reveal coming March 14th. There's just a lot of news to talk about. For our listeners, just want to signpost, this is going to be a long episode, probably one of the longest ones that I've done, and of the hosts of Industry Focus, I'm one of the longer-running ones.

John, before we dive into this recent news about Tesla, I want to give Tesla and Elon some credit. Back in 2010, when Tesla IPOed, it was the first U.S. automaker to enter the market in 54 years. Came from a standing start at zero and it's up 10 times since IPO. When you look at the brand that Tesla's built and what they've accomplished so far, what stands out to you with their brand and how significant the growth of they've achieved in the past few years has been?

Rosevear: In the early days after Tesla went public, it was common for me to hear from readers, ""Tesla is disrupting the auto business!"" And I said, ""Back up!"" They haven't necessarily disrupted the auto business, but they have entered the auto business, and that is a really, really hard thing. We should give them credit for that. Just to be building cars beyond hand-built-in-the-garage level is a big deal. This is a fiendishly difficult business to enter at all, much less to make money in. They have certainly entered it, they've made a huge splash. Whether they're making money consistently yet or not, jury's still out. [laughs] But they've done a good job. They build cars that that their customers love, love, love. They've established a huge presence. They've influenced other automakers who are all of a sudden now scrambling to go electric, following Tesla's example, that electric cars don't have to be these miserly eco-minded things. They can be fun, they can even be better than their conventionally powered counterparts.

All of that is huge. It's seismic. You could argue that he's already accomplished his mission to accelerate humanity's movement toward sustainable transport, toward electric cars rather than internal combustion cars. His influence is massive.

That said, that's somewhat separate from whether Tesla is going to thrive as an investment. That's the conversation here today.

Sciple: Exactly. He really made EVs cool. In 2018, Tesla was over 10% of global EV sales. They've really made a significant move into the auto market. They tout their large amounts of autonomous data and their fleet of cars using autopilot. They have a network of superchargers. And at least until recently, they've built a robust brand of retail stores.

But in the past few months, the story around Tesla has changed. For the longest time, the questions around Tesla came on the issue of supply. Is Tesla going to be able to make the Model 3 at high quality and at scale? Tesla faced some difficult issues there. Back in November, Elon Musk said to Axios on HBO that during the ramp of the Model 3, Tesla faced ""a severe threat of death. Essentially the company was bleeding money like crazy, and if we didn't solve these problems in a very short period of time, we would die."" Of course, Tesla did seemingly solve those problems and has reached volume production.

However, the recent questions around the company have to do with demand.

Rosevear: That's an interesting point. For years, the investment discussion around Tesla was, how quickly can they ramp up? How quickly can they make more and more cars? The question of, will people line up to buy these cars when they're making a million a year is now starting to come into focus a little bit. What's the real demand for these vehicles at their current state of technology, at their current state of market penetration, at their current state of the competitive universe? What is the demand? I wonder if we're now starting to see it, and that it may not be quite as unlimited as some heavy-hitting investors have assumed.

Sciple: Right. We saw Elon on the Q4 conference call say he thinks that ""demand for the Model 3 is insanely high, but the inhibitor is affordability."" Folks literally don't have the money to buy the car.

Rosevear: Sure, but that's true of Ferrari, too. If Ferrari was building $20,000 cars, they'd sell a lot more than 8,000 a year, wouldn't they? [laughs]

Sciple: Yes. When you take an economics class, it's how much demand at a given price point. The first thing we want to talk about today is the news that we got last week, announced on February 28th, that Tesla was going to make significant price cuts across the board on all its models of vehicles. We got the long-awaited $35,000 Model 3 as well as the Model S and X were cut from about $12,000 to about $8,000, and even more so overseas. In Taiwan, the price of the Model S P100D dropped by almost $100,000, which prompted protests in the country. Electrek quoted that some vehicles have been devalued as much as 40%.

John, we have these questions about demand, and we see really significant price cuts across the board on all the models of vehicles. What does this signal for us as investors, this really abrupt price drop by Tesla?

Rosevear: Well, clearly it signals that Elon is just now able to cut prices because their manufacturing is so advanced and he's doing this out of the goodness of his heart to speed the acceleration of adoption of electric vehicles! At least, that's what my Twitter followers tell me. The reality here looks a little different. It really does look like, from all of the evidence we can see, that Tesla knows that its early adopters all have their products, and the move into the mass mainstream isn't happening quite the way they'd hoped. So, now they've got to stir up demand, they've got to start to pull some demand levers and a very big, very aggressive demand lever is to cut the prices.

Sciple: Exactly. We saw in January and February significant declines in sales of the Model 3 from what we had seen at the end of 2018. To throw some numbers at you, in December, Model 3 sales were around 25,000. Those declined to 6,500 in January, and then a further decline to 5,750 in February. Those are the lowest sales of the Model 3 since around May 2018, when the Model 3 ramp was just beginning in earnest. On the positive side of this story, there is significantly more demand for vehicles in general in this lower price range than there are for these luxury vehicles Tesla has been selling. Demand for cars in the $35,000 price range is reported as 5X higher than cars placed $55,000 and above. So, there may be some demand there.

What's concerning for me is the steps that Tesla has had to make to bring these costs down. What they have done is announced that they're going to close the vast majority of their stores. To quote directly from Tesla's blog post announcing this, Tesla says that ""to achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla needs to shift sales worldwide to online only."" They'll keep a small number of stores in high-traffic locations as galleries, showcases, and Tesla information centers, and we're going to reassign or lay off retail workers. This is the third round of layoffs that Tesla has announced in the past six months. There was a 7% workforce reduction in January primarily targeting delivery sales and Model S production employees. There was another round of layoffs in 2018.

John, as we see, Tesla has really touted these retail stores as being a significant driver of demand for the Tesla brand.

Rosevear: Of course, the most bullish investors tell us, it's just like the Apple Stores, as part of their argument for why Tesla is this disruptive company. They're getting out there with this very polished retail presence that they control end-to-end rather than franchise dealers like other automakers. And this is an important part of the story and an important part of upselling their customers. Rather than buy the Model 3, why don't you buy a Model S? Oh, you're buying a Model S, maybe you want a Powerwall, maybe you want a solar roof, this kind of thing. This has all been part of the story. And now, poof! It's gone.

Sciple: Right! Just to call out how abrupt this swerve has been, in Q4 of 2018, Tesla opened 27 new retail and service centers, the most it had ever opened in a single quarter since 2017. They called out in their 10-K, published nine days before this price cut announcement and the announcement they were going to cut all of their retail locations they said that their Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible premium outlets in major metropolitan markets; opening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand; and, they had plans to more rapidly expand their retail footprint. Of course, that's on an SEC filing under oath nine days before this announcement. You'll see in all of these SEC filings this phrase that the statements in that filing reflect the current expectations of management.

Why have management's expectations shifted so abruptly in a less-than-two-week period?

Rosevear: I think Elon got the mid-month sales report in February. [laughs] I really think that's probably it. They gave him the update and said, ""Boss, things aren't going so well."" And he's like, ""Whoa! We've got to do all these things now. What do we have to cut to get the $35,000 Model 3 out now?"" or whenever it was earlier in February.

I think it's really seat-of-the-pants here. You were saying something before we started recording the show about building the aircraft while it's in-flight. [laughs] There's a sense of that. I mean, there's always been a sense of that with Tesla to some extent. It's still kind of a start-up, even though it's, what, 16 years old now or something like that. And there's a real sense in the last couple of months that Elon is winging it, and that he's winging it very quickly. ""We're going to do this. We're going to do this."" It's these major changes that shift the business and effect hundreds or thousands of employees and contractors and suppliers and so forth, that have all of these repercussions way down the chain. And he's just reacting.

Sciple: Right. We'll talk about this later, too. Even the call to announce this was rushed. It was a call to selected reporters, was not open to the public.

Rosevear: Was not open to a lot of people who cover Tesla on a day-to-day basis. It was a small invitation list, and they left off some surprising names. I wasn't on the call, but I mean, people who Tesla is part of their beat were not on this. It was a little surprising. They were looking for a very particular audience. [laughs]

Sciple: Right. They announced revised Q1 guidance, they wouldn't be profitable. All these in the same week that the SEC filed contempt charges against Musk for flaws in Tesla's communications. We'll talk about that a little bit later.

Continuing on about the retail strategy, one question I have is a big part of Elon Musk's master plan has been to build out both these electric vehicles with complementary solar services. In selling the solar products, Tesla has repeatedly cited the importance of these retail locations to sell solar products. So when they announced the Solar City merger, they said they were trying to build an integrated product that you could just walk into a Tesla store and just get the solar panels, and it all just works.

Rosevear: In fact, this was a big part of how they sold the merger to shareholders. That was the vision. This was the whole thing.

Sciple: Right. Again, going back to what Tesla reported in Q4, they reported their lowest number of installed solar systems in five years. In explaining the issues that Tesla had had in selling volumes of solar panels, they said, ""We are still in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles."" So, if the reason the solar business wasn't doing well was because the retail store employees had not been properly trained to sell the solar products, now that these retail store employees are no longer going to be employed by the company, how does Tesla plan to sell its solar products?

Rosevear: This isn't the thing you can sell online. [laughs] It just isn't. These are expensive, elaborate systems. They involve teams of people coming out to your house for several weeks. This isn't trivial stuff. This isn't a car, this isn't a pair of shoes. This is something pretty major. I don't know how you sell it online. I don't know that they're going to sell very many online. I don't know if they're going to sell any online.

Sciple: Yeah. It's definitely going to be a story to continue to watch. There's also been reports out of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo that they've been facing a lot of issues when it comes to production.

Rosevear: We have to explain what the Gigafactory at Buffalo. It's a solar panel factory.

Sciple: Sure, do you want explain that for our listeners?

Rosevear: It's where they make the solar panels. The idea was, they got funding or tax breaks or something to build this factory in Buffalo, New York. It was going to crank out these advanced solar roofs that Elon demo-ed around the time of the Solar City acquisition as part of the case for this. This factory -- well, you were about to say, go ahead -- it's having some issues.

Sciple: Yeah, it's had some issues. These are reports from the Buffalo News and local reporters. They're talking to employees at the factory. Production has been not ramping up in any significant way over a long period of time. Employees have been watching videos on the job. The culture there around that factory has really been poor. Really, a lot of question marks. We're actually seeing some New York politicians raising some questions about what's going on at that Gigafactory in Buffalo. So, when it comes to the solar business, this change to both the retail strategy as well as what's going on at the factory raises a lot of question marks as to what role that solar business is going to play for Tesla going into the future.

Outside of the solar business, there's some questions about how Tesla is going to sell their cars. When they announced this move to all-online sales, Elon Musk called out that 78% of Model 3 orders had been made online, and 82% of those had been made without a test drive. However, it's worth noting that the Model 3 wasn't in many stores. It had a very limited test drive fleet in 2018. And, it doesn't account for customers that may have gotten their first exposure to Tesla in the store and may have purchased. There's been some really strong anecdotal evidence both on Twitter, and I think one employee at The Motley Fool, that Tesla salespeople have been a huge part of pushing folks that are reservation holders to finally come through and make these orders.

Now that these employees are no longer there, what effect, if any, do you think the absence of Tesla stores will have when it comes to driving purchases for the Model 3?

Rosevear: Let's back up for a second and talk about this as a business model. We've talked about this in the past, how new technology becomes mainstream. It starts with early adopters. Then, at some point, it has to break out into the mass market. There are social scientists who have documented this and offered theories for this. There's a point popularly referred to as Crossing the Chasm, where you cross from the hardcore early adopters into the mainstream mass market. The stores were how they were going to do it. I'm often in New York City, there's one store I walk past all the time. It's near an Apple store. It's near a big Starbucks. It's near a Google location, where a lot of Google employees work. It's very well-situated, it's in Chelsea, around the West Side. You start to see well-heeled, tech-oriented mainstream folks walk by the Tesla store, and they walk in. This is how they start to bring new people into the fold and so forth. If it's all online, how does that work? Are they relying on word-of-mouth from their hardcore enthusiast donors to cross the chasm, to get into the mainstream market? I don't know how this is going to work.

Sciple: Right. It's worth noting that in the past few months, Tesla's radically cut back its referral program, which would be the case that, ""Hey, our existing owners are going to drive sales."" Without those incentives there, they may be less incentive to do those sorts of things.

The other question mark has to do with, in eliminating these test drives, what Elon Musk has called out as making that possible is this new return policy that they're going to have for these vehicles. If you purchase the vehicle, you can drive it for up to seven days or 1,000 miles, and if you don't like it, you can return it for a full refund. Elon has said, ""we're going to make it super easy to get a refund. People really shouldn't be concerned about placing an order or thinking there's not reversibility. We want to make it incredibly easy to get a refund."" However, given Tesla's track record on refunding people their deposits and purchases, can we really trust Tesla to refund these purchases properly? What do you think, John?

Rosevear: There's a whole another issue here, which people haven't been talking about so much, related to the refunds. You put 1,000 miles on a car, it's worth less than it was when it was new. Who takes that depreciation hit? They're going to make the refund and take that depreciation hit, and try to sell the car used? Are we going to have a pile of Model 3s hitting auctions? What is that going to do it a residual values? Used car pricing? Their abilities to do leasing when that comes up?

Also, as I know that you've said in the past, and perhaps you can expound on this for us, Tesla hasn't been so good about giving the refunds.

Sciple: Right. We got reporting out of CNBC. Reporter Lora Kolodny, in the past month or so, spoke to more than a dozen Tesla customers. We'll drop a link to this article in the description of the podcast so our listeners can take a look at it for themselves. She reviewed their correspondence with the company and their financial records. The issues are really surprising for a company as big as Tesla. Bounce a $1,000 check for a refunded reservation fee. You had Tesla, instead of refunding the reservation fee, refunding the full $40,000 that someone paid for the car. You had people getting repaid but getting no communication or notification from Tesla. Those sorts of things are taking place. In the most extreme cases, we've had customers waiting weeks or months to get refunds in excess of $10,000. The customers cited in that article talked about repeatedly communicating with Tesla sales staff and those sorts of things to try to get those issues resolved. However, with those sales staff getting laid off in significant ways across the board, I think it's reasonable to question whether these issues might not only not improve, but may deteriorate as the staff that is there to service customers no longer works at the company. What are your thoughts on that, John?

Rosevear: Best case, these anecdotes speak to either poorly trained staff or poor systems. They aren't able to just log into the system and click refund and the check automatically prints and mails. They've got some issue going on. Worst case, maybe there's a policy to stall on refunds as long as possible to keep Tesla's cash balance as high as possible, especially around quarter-end when they have to show it to the world. I don't know. Again, best case, this is not the level of organization we expect of a 16-year-old, $50 billion company. Worst case, there's shenanigans going on here. And it's very strange.

Sciple: Definitely something to watch as refunds become a more significant part of Tesla's selling strategy than even they have been to date.

The other question that popped up to me when we look at all these stores that are going to be shut down is, there's going to be a lot of costs associated with this. It's going to be a really complicated financial transaction. You're going to have to cancel all your leases with malls. Just since the beginning of March, they've closed 32 stores. We've seen several mall-related businesses trade down as a result of Tesla's announcement. Then, you've got severance pay for store workers. If you're going to lay off a large number of these workers, you're going to have to pay them severance. And there has been some reporting that Tesla is making moves to maybe try to encourage these workers to quit rather than being laid off. There's been some reporting that Tesla has eliminated all bonus compensation for their retail staff. Those bonuses represented the majority of their income. What are your thoughts on that, and thoughts on the complexity of this transaction for Tesla?

Rosevear: That this is a strategic move that was not fully thought out, and that the company's cash strapped. [laughs] Which is consistent with everything else we've said so far, right, about the current state of Tesla. If Ford Motor Company lays off a bunch of people, they pay out the severance and then maybe they take it as a one-time charge against earnings so that it doesn't go to their adjusted income, and they can say, ""This is a thing that happened. It's not an ongoing thing."" And investors roll with that, and say, ""OK, we see that."" If Tesla is worried about to its quarterly report, that's one thing. But it seems almost like they're holding onto cash as tightly as possible here. It's really weird. [laughs] I mean, it's weird, except that that context explains it.

Sciple: Right. One last thing to mention, Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's longtime CFO, he had two stints at the company, abruptly resigned on the last quarter's conference call. We now have a new CFO at Tesla that's going to be managing this really complicated financial transaction, Zach Kirkhorn. 34 years old with no CFO experience. Does that raise any red flags to you, or concerns, given that someone with less-than-ideal experience will be navigating these transactions, getting all these leases off the books?

Rosevear: I do wonder what's going on here. I mean, I don't know Zach Kirkhorn. He may be very sharp. He's probably very sharp. He's probably sharp enough to impress Elon. That doesn't mean he has the experience or the knowledge to do this. I don't know who on his team might have it, given the high turnover in the finance department at Tesla. Deepak's departure was just crazy. It was a drop at the end of the conference call. ""By the way, I'm leaving. Bye."" [laughs] You know?! It was almost that. Here, we're having our quarterly conference call, and, by the way, I'm gone. See ya. Did he decide that earlier that day? What happened here?! What is the story? We don't know the story yet. Nobody's managed to report it out.

But, we know where all this points. This is a company that is flying by the seat of its pants, with a CFO who may be in way over his head in terms of hard business finance questions, who is improvising in a situation where there may be a serious cash crunch that isn't readily visible to us.

Sciple: Right, John. That's what I wanted to ask you. With as complicated and abrupt as these price cuts have been, and eliminating the retail stores that had been a really key part of both Tesla's solar and mass-market strategy, why is Tesla choosing this route rather than raising cash via debt or equity to finance the company as it overcomes at least the demand problems that they're facing today? Why is Tesla not raising money?

Rosevear: The community of Tesla skeptics on Twitter and elsewhere is convinced that for some reason, they can't. That the SEC has told them privately that they would have to disclose something or they're blocked somehow. Or, maybe, alternatively, that the banks who have led their funding rounds in the past have said, ""No, you have to show us profitability. We can't go back to this well."" Or, you run the serious risk of trying to do a $2 billion raise or whatever it having it be undersubscribed, which is not going to support your stock price, if that happens, to say the least.

Sciple: Sure, John. Let's transition now to talking a little bit about what's going on abroad. At the end of the last quarter, Elon called out that there's going to be significant demand in Europe and China for these vehicles. In this conference call last week, I mentioned that Elon updated guidance, saying they don't expect to be profitable in Q1 both due to the restructuring of their stores and the layoffs having to do with their retail locations, but as well with challenges getting cars to China and Europe. Let's talk a little bit about what's going on in China and Europe.

Recently, we've seen news in China having to do with import issues there with customs. Do you want to explain that a little bit to our listeners? What's going on in China?

Rosevear: China suspended imports of the Model 3s. Their customs inspector said there are irregularities, including things that were labeled incorrectly and so forth. They cited problems with 1,600 cars. There are a whole bunch that are still being held. The Chinese officials did agree this was something that Tesla could fix on-site, in the port, in the impound area, wherever the cars are being held. Tesla is apparently doing that under the eye of the customs officials. They'll be able to import, the clearances will resume, once they get this straightened out.

But, as always in China, we wonder if there's a little deeper thing going on here. [laughs] What that might be is, did Tesla not have the right agreements with the right officials to bring the cars in? Did Tesla leave off something obvious that has raised the ire of some leadership of the customs people or something like that? What's going on here?

Sciple: Right. It could be as innocent as, there's been reporting in the past couple of months that Tesla was really rushing to get their vehicles onto boats and shipped off to China in fears that as President Trump's delay of increased tariffs on China took place, there were some fears that they might not be able to get the cars there before there's tariffs bumped up. So, it's possible that Tesla, in their rush to get those cars on the ships --

Rosevear: As we've seen elsewhere in our discussion here, Tesla is not always the most organized, meticulous company, especially with one of these Elon-on-the-fly kind of things. It might just have been exhausted people working 18 hours a day to get these cars on the ship, and on their way to China things were missed. Things weren't communicated. Things like that. It's entirely possible that that's what's going on. It's also entirely possible that because of some of those same factors, they didn't get their story straight with China. They didn't understand exactly what they needed to be doing to bring them into the country. They didn't have the agreement from the customs officials that would be overseeing this. Whatever. Some breakdown has obviously happened. It might just be -- in fact, it probably is, Occam's razor suggests it's just because of Tesla's tendency of doing things on-the-fly, quickly, at the last minute, under stress, and so forth.

Sciple: Yeah. Regardless, definitely something to be aware of for investors, particularly with the significance of China as a market for Tesla moving forward.

Another part of the China story for Tesla has been the construction of the Chinese Gigafactory that Elon has been touting over the past few months. He said in the Q4 conference call, ""We really need to bring the Shanghai factory online. It's the biggest variable for getting to 500,000-plus vehicles a year. "" They need the Shanghai factory to achieve at 10,000-a-week run rate and have the cars be affordable. Do you have something to say about that, John?

Rosevear: 10,000 car rate. 10,000 cars a week is the long-held goal. ""We're going to build 10,000 Model 3s a week."" But they need the second factory to do it because they can't do it in Fremont.

Sciple: Sure. The question mark that we've seen around this Chinese factory is that this has been touted as something that Tesla is going to construct. But we still have not seen financing announced for this factory. Tesla has said that they're going to have the factory under construction this summer. There's been a report from Reuters from a Shanghai official that the construction of the factory -- at least, the factory itself, without the machinery in it -- would be completed in May. What, if anything, do you take from the fact that we have not seen any announcement from Tesla when it comes to how this factory is going to be financed, particularly because it's currently under construction?

Rosevear: I don't get it. [laughs] And I seem to be saying that a lot. I fear our listeners are like, ""God, this Rosevear guy's an idiot."" But I've been looking at this company for years, and there's a lot of, we haven't heard the whole story yet. There's something here that's not right. That's what we keep saying over and over here. There is somebody who is in the area in Shanghai who has been taking pictures of the site. We've seen it go from a mud pit. They've built workers barracks now where they're going to bring in workers who will live on-site and build it maybe around the clock, for all we know. It's not implausible that if they mount a full-blown effort and do build around the clock, they'll have the building up by May. It's not implausible that if they mount a well-organized, full-blown effort, they will have machinery in place by the end of the year and be able to crank out a few cars before the end of 2019.

Neither of those things will be cheap, even in China. And, as you've said, we don't know who's paying for this. We don't know how this is being financed. Tesla has never released an 8-K saying, ""We've got funding for this."" What deals have they cut to make this happen, and with who? What have they given up? We don't know.

Sciple: Right. There is a lack of transparency that, to me, is concerning. We saw on the Q4 conference call, I believe, CFO Deepak Ahuja had mentioned that they had received attractive financing offers from local Chinese banks. But, again, we still haven't seen announcement of that financing. Something I've been watching out for in the past month or so, and a thing we're continuing to wait on.

I want to transition now to what's going on in Europe. Europe has faced some import issues of its own. The first issue I want to call out is, right off the bat, the first week into European imports, right when the vehicles were coming off the boat, Tesla had hired a company called ICO to handle getting those vehicles unloaded from the ships and preparing them for delivery to distribution centers. However, less than one week into those imports, Tesla fired ICO and decided to take over those duties, at least the duties when it comes to prepping the vehicles for delivery to Tesla distribution centers, take that over itself. Does this raise any concerns for you, John? It seems to me, these types of services are something you'd want someone who specializes in this sort of thing doing. What do you think about the idea that they fired their import agent less than one week into importing vehicles into Europe?

Rosevear: Again, there's a story we haven't heard. It could be as simple as, Tesla didn't like the way the company was prepping the cars and decided to do it themselves. Maybe the first dozen arrived dirty or something. I think Elon was onsite for a day or two here, and it's possible he said, ""No, you guys aren't doing it right. We're just going to do it ourselves from now on."" It's also possible that there was some financial thing, that this company said, ""We need payment for the first three months in advance because of your uncertain financial condition,"" and Elon said, ""No, we're not doing that. Go away."" [laughs] I don't know. There's a story here and, again, we don't know it. But it is a little odd. I can come up with several semi-reasonable explanations for why they might have chosen to do this. Certainly, Tesla preps cars for delivery in the United States to its own customers. It knows how to do this as a company. Whether it's got the people on the ground near the port and so forth to do this in Europe, I don't know. I would think that would be something that would be doable fairly quickly, though. But, again, we don't know quite what happened here.

Sciple: Sure. Moving on to some additional issues we've seen. They've had delayed type approval of their vehicles in Europe. At least the early deliveries of their vehicles had to have autopilot disabled. We've seen German regulators require Tesla to change how it shows its pricing on its website. They claimed that the fuel savings that Tesla was reporting were unclear and misleading for consumers. What are your thoughts on both of those regulatory issues that Tesla has faced on importing its vehicles into Europe?

Rosevear: Tesla's use of fuel savings has been unclear and misleading in the United States for years. German regulators are tougher about that kind of thing than American regulators. [laughs] Yeah, I remember when the Model S launched, they were assuming gas was $5 a gallon or something like that at the time, when it was not. But because gas prices are always going up, it will be over the life of the vehicle, was what somebody said at the time.

To some extent, this is just, ""We're entering a market for the first time. We're doing this by the seat of our pants. We haven't hired people who are experts to advise us, we haven't spent months and months planning this carefully,"" which is, to some extent, typical Tesla, certainly in recent times. Ready, fire, aim. We're just going to ship into Europe, and we'll figure it out when we get there, let's go. So, on one level, I don't make that much about it. This is Tesla bumping into regulation in a market that it's newly entering where it hasn't done all of the research, dotted all the i's and crossed the t's beforehand. Which is Tesla, and which is not necessarily bearish for the stock in and of itself. If you assume they'll figure it all out eventually and everybody gets their cars in a week or two, then it's really no big deal. But it's just more typical what we've seen over the company in recent times.

Sciple: Sure. Another thing for Tesla investors to watch.

Now I want to transition into talking about the Model Y. On Sunday, March 3rd, three days after this conference call to announce the $35,000 Model 3, Elon announced via Twitter that Tesla would unveil the Model Y SUV on March 14th at Tesla's LA design studio. The first question I have for you, John, this, again, seems to be rushed, given that you had a Thursday announcement of very significant changes to the business that were concerning. The stock price traded down in a significant way the following day. Why was the Model Y not announced until Sunday following this big announcement on Thursday? Any thoughts there?

Rosevear: It is possible that this is another example of Elon flying by the seat of his pants. What has been going on in the rest of the auto industry this past week is the Geneva Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland, which is the big European auto show. The theme here is electric vehicles. There are a lot of them being showed. Audi just showed an electric crossover SUV one size down from the e-tron that they're going to begin building before long that is aimed squarely at what we think the Model Y is going to be. It's the same kind of vehicle. It's the same size. It's Audi's execution. They're building it on the Volkswagen Group 's mass-market electric vehicle platform, so they'll be able to keep costs down and either deliver it at an aggressive price or make it nicely profitable for them, possibly both depending on trim level. They're clearly out to get Tesla with this.

Volvo, with its corporate parent, Chinese automaker, Geely, has launched a brand called Pollstar, they just announced a similar product, an all-electric crossover SUV that, again, is coming right at the Model Y's territory. It'll be built in China. That will help keep the costs down and so forth, and exported. This could be a very powerful contender. Yes, it's a new brand, but when I look at it, I see a Volvo. Volvo's reputation for safety and so forth is very strong. That will help sell them. Mercedes has the EQC, a compact crossover SUV coming that's all-electric.

This might just be Elon saying, ""Our competitors are getting out there before we are in this important, important, important model segment."" Compact crossovers, especially upscale ones, have been booming in sales all over the world. It might just be Elon saying, ""We have to show something so that we can pre-empt people who might be placing reservations on some of these other vehicles now or soon."" In that sense, it might just be, again, him reacting to something and improvising a solution on the fly. ""Let's get this thing out there. Let's put together something we can show people. How long do you need to put something together that we can show? Two weeks? Let's do it!"" [laughs] It might have happened that quickly.

Sciple: Right. When you talk about the demand for these compact crossovers, on the Q4 conference call, Elon when talking about the Model Y says he expects demand to be maybe 50% higher than the Model 3, maybe even double. The question I have for you, John, we just had the long-awaited $35,000 Model 3, which a large number of deposit holders had been waiting for a long period of time. With this new Model Y coming out, how will the reveal of that car affect appetites for people to buy this $35,000 Model 3, knowing that this Model Y SUV, very popular among consumers, will be reaching market soon? Do you think there's any chance that the Model Y will cannibalize demand for this new $35,000 Model 3, and the price cuts across the board on Tesla's vehicles?

Rosevear: Depends. How quickly are they going to get out a $35,000 Model Y? If I've been waiting three years for a car, I don't want to wait three more years for the for the mythical $35,000 Model Y. At some point, I'm going to go buy something else because I need a car. [laughs] I'm going to reup on the Prius and maybe get the next Tesla or something like that. A lot of these people who got on that pre-order list for the Model 3 seem to have been people for whom a $35,000 car is a stretch. They're young folks, they're folks who are not employed in high-paying, high-tech jobs. They do other things with their lives. And they were maybe counting on the federal government incentives, which are now fading down, and some other things to be able to buy this car comfortably. And now, OK, it's here, and we're starting to see it. I don't know how many of them are going to transition to the Y.

With a normal automaker, sure. We'd say the crossover is going to way outsell the sedan right no, that's a no-brainer. With Tesla, I don't know. If we're still working with a core group of early adopters, how many people are going to reach into their pockets again? How many people are going to reach in for a Model Y? Given how the Model 3 rollout has gone, where it took much longer to get to market, it cost more... sure, the reviews of its handling and acceleration are great, but the car has had other problems, assembly problems, problems that suggest it wasn't fully tested in winter conditions, and so forth. You've got Consumer Reports wavering on it and so forth. I don't think they're going to get 400,000 pre-orders, real, genuine, honest-to-goodness customer pre-orders, for the Model Y, right now, especially given growing economic concern around the world. That's another thing we haven't even talked about. Auto sales are cyclical, and it's late in the cycle. That will be true of Tesla, just as it's true of Ford and BMW and everybody else.

People who are looking at this and saying, ""They'll have a million pre-orders for the Model Y,"" it's not happening. It's not. I don't know how the market will react to the Model Y. It's possible that they'll show the Model Y, and the market will go, ""Alright, call us when it's closer to production."" Or, that's what most people looking at it will say. ""Alright, we'll see."" We've heard a lot of promises from Tesla that don't necessarily translate into the production of vehicles.

Sciple: Sure. On the topic of production, the other question there is where is the Model Y going to be built? In the Q4 press release from Tesla, they had said it's most likely going to be constructed at Gigafactory 1. However, some reporting speaking to folks inside the plant have questioned whether there is room for another production line along with the X, S, and Model 3 production lines in the Fremont production factory. Before we started taping the show, you had mentioned a story that came out maybe 20 minutes before we started taping, John, related to that. Where is Tesla going to build the Model Y? Do we have any idea where that's going to take place?

Rosevear: If Tesla were a normal automaker that followed normal automaker practice, it would be a no-brainer. They'd build it right on the line with the 3, and they would vary the proportions of Ys and 3s coming out of the factory every day in alignment with what they were seeing in trends in customer demand so that they were ready to go. That's how other automakers do this.

I assume, because it is the way that would make sense, that the Model Y is built on the same platform or architecture, as we say. It shares many of the same underpinnings. The industry lingo for this is a new top hat. You have the vehicle architecture, which is where most of the engineering effort and cost goes. Then, you have the body you put on top of it. To put a crossover SUV body on an architecture that was developed for a sedan is not a complicated undertaking if you've designed it all from the beginning with that in mind. I mean, it's horrendously complicated, but it's an established practice. It's relatively straightforward to build them both on the same assembly line. You do need some new tooling and so forth to make the body parts, to make the different interior bits, or to buy them, or places to store them if you buy them, and you need some additional training for the employees. You may need to reconfigure things a bit in the factory. If they were planning the Model Y from the beginning of the Model 3 program, it would be a straightforward exercise.

That said, it appears from their comments and from what we're hearing in recent days that it's not going to go that way. So, where are they going to build it? I don't know. It's interesting that they were going to build it in Nevada, where labor costs may be fairly inexpensive, certainly compared to California, and regulations are lighter. But, is there a pool of established automakers and so forth? Can they hire enough people? Can they train them up in time? How long does that take? What does Panasonic, their manufacturing partner at the Gigafactory, have to say about all this?

Again, it speaks to Tesla, or Mr. Musk, perhaps, making announcements before things have been thought through. I don't know. They may not know yet. They may just say, ""We have to show the thing right now and start taking pre-orders."" For all I know, they're going to end up building it in Shanghai and shipping it to the United States. I have no idea if that's actually how it will go, but it's a plausible solution right now if they do get that Shanghai factory built. I don't know. Nobody knows. Again, there seems to be no plan.

Sciple: We saw the Model 3 being built in a tent. That's always an option. [laughs] We'll see what happens.

Rosevear: Going to need a bigger tent. [laughs]

Sciple: [laughs] Yep. Let's transition to talking about the other news that came out from Tesla last week, which was the SEC recommending that Elon Musk be held in contempt of court. For our listeners who aren't familiar with what contempt of court is, being in contempt of court means either misbehaving in the courtroom or, in this case, deliberately disobeying a court order. The court order that's relevant for this case for Elon and Tesla, I'm sure everyone remembers back in August, Elon's $420 go private #fundingsecured tweet, which led him to be charged with securities fraud by the SEC, and which triggered the settlement that is relevant in this contempt of court case.

Rosevear: We should note, that's a civil charge, not a criminal charge, by the way, when they say securities fraud. It comes out of a set of securities rules. It is serious. It's not go-to-jail serious. It's pay-a-big-fine serious. Just to clarify that.

Sciple: Right. To put some numbers on that fine, both Tesla and Elon Musk were tasked to pay $20 million in penalties each. The relevant part of that settlement agreement that's at issue in this contempt of court case is the agreement that Tesla would put in place controls over Elon Musk's Twitter that would pre-approve communications. This contempt charge arises from a Twitter post Elon Musk made a couple of weeks ago that Tesla would make around 500,000 cars in 2019. This was materially different from the 400,000 target set at the end of January. And, it was not vetted prior to being released. Elon had to correct that tweet subsequently after consultation with Dane Butswinkas, Tesla's since-departed general counsel. Changed his tweet to say, ""Meant to say annualized production rate at the end of 2019 around 500,000.""

The SEC in their complaint has said, ""Elon once again published inaccurate and material information about Tesla to over 24 million Twitter followers, including members of the press, and made this inaccurate information available to anyone with internet access."" Again, SEC said in its motion that Elon had not made a good faith or diligent effort to comply with the settlement, citing Elon's on 60 Minutes, where he said he did not respect the SEC and acknowledged that he did not have his tweets reviewed prior to releasing them, and that ""mistakes may be made,"" and also cited a tweet in October where Musk mocked the SEC, calling it ""the short-seller enrichment commission.""

As we look at all these SEC issues surrounding Tesla and Elon Musk with regard to this contempt charge, what concerns, if any, should investors have?

Rosevear: That they might say he can't be CEO for a while. [laughs] They have the power to do that! ""You can't be director and officer of a public company for X years."" We call that a DNO ban in the business. That's a penalty that can be doled out. It depends on whether the SEC politically feels it prudent to go gently on Tesla because of its prominence or to make an example out of him. As he pushes his luck, that argument is going to tend more toward making an example. I don't know if were there yet, but we may find out.

At minimum, there will be something coming down on Elon. It might just be another fine that sounds big to you and me but is small with Tesla backstopping Elon's fortune. Maybe the very worst case, though, is they can say, ""Alright, we're throwing the settlement out. Now we're going to prosecute you."" [laughs] ""Now we get into criminal securities fraud. We're going to come at you."" [laughs] ""And, by the way, let's send over an FBI team and start digging through your records at the Palo Alto headquarters and see what we find in the finance department."" That would be a very difficult situation for Tesla and for Tesla investors hoping that the stock price stays lofty. [laughs]

Sciple: Right. The options available to the SEC at this juncture are really anything in the grab bag. You mentioned the DNO ban, a fine, which is definitely going to be higher than the $40 million doled out previously. Something to watch.

The other question that I had arising from Elon's tweet and the follow-on from the contempt charge is, what exactly is Tesla's production guidance? We have a few figures floating around here. In Tesla's 8-K and fourth quarter update letter, they forecasted 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles produced. However, in that conference call Q&A for that same quarter, released on that same day, January 30th, Elon announced a target of 350,000 to 500,000 vehicles. However, on the tweet on February 19th, Elon said they were going to produce around 500,000 vehicles. Then, again, on the follow-up tweet on February 19th, he said they were going to produce about 400,000 vehicles. Then, on February 25th, Elon again went back to this 350,000 to 500,000 number quoted on the Q4 conference call. And then, on February 28th conference call, Elon announced a production guidance range of 420,000 to 600,000 vehicles produced.

So, we've got three or four competing numbers announced in the past month and a half from Elon Musk and Tesla. Do we have any clear picture of what the production guidance is for Tesla in 2019?

Rosevear: You just gave the production picture for Tesla in 2019, [laughs] as they see it. No, of course we don't. There are so many variables in here. What is demand for the Model 3, really? What's happening in China, really? What's happening at the Nevada Gigafactory, really? It's hard to see. Again, what I'm taking from this is, ""We don't know, we haven't done a detailed analysis, we're flying by the seat of our pants."" That's one thing for a start-up with 12 people, it's another thing for a company like this. It's just the thing we've been saying over and over today. They're unorganized, they aren't meticulous around communications, certainly, as well as other things we've seen.

Elon says, ""We're going to do this,"" and it's off the top of his head. Maybe he remembers what he said last time and says the same thing, and maybe he's got a conversation where he's talking about different numbers and then asked, and then off the top of his head, it's not the same numbers. I think that's probably all that's happening here. There's no deeper intent to give figures all over the place. It's just that they don't have an official guidance, really, except that because Elon says it, and he's the CEO, and he's the very public spokesperson for this company, when he says it, it becomes official guidance.

Sciple: Right, which is what the SEC is bringing their contempt charge. Twitter and things like that have been deemed official ways to release Tesla's information. When those things are unclear, the SEC is going to come knocking.

Rosevear: Among other things, there may have been places where there was intent to mislead. But there's also just a lack of organization and a lack of structure to the way they present this. I think that was part of what the SEC was going after with the settlement. You need some supervision. You need somebody to oversee this before you just blurt out, ""Oh, we're going to build a million cars this year."" You've got to have somebody say, ""Yeah, but you said 400,000 last week. We have to be consistent."" I think that's part of what the SEC was imposing, just recognizing the reality of how Elon operates and saying, ""We have to put a little structure around this because these things you are saying offhand have serious consequences.""

Sciple: Sure. John, the next story around Tesla that I want to talk about briefly, and you mentioned it earlier, is this idea of Consumer Reports pulling its recommendation for the Model 3 due to reliability issues. Consumer Reports has already pulled recommendations from the Model S, and I believe the Model X never received a recommendation from Consumer Reports. Consumer Reports identified a number of problems with the cars, including issues with body hardware as well as paint and trim. One common issue -- and this is an issue that Consumer Reports even had on its demo vehicle -- is the glass window in the back of the vehicle has a tendency of cracking in a T-shaped pattern.

When you look at the issues that Consumer Reports cited when it comes to reliability with Tesla's vehicles, what questions does that raise for you as an investor? How do you think about that when you look at this company?

Rosevear: It's interesting that I can say the same thing. Again, this is what happens when you ready-fire-aim. This is what happens when you rush a vehicle to market to meet a deadline that you've blurted out on an investor call when the thing was not properly tested the way that a company like BMW or Audi or Ford or GM or any of these other companies we've talked about will test a vehicle before it brings it to market.

We had a lot of reports of Model 3s, for instance, with frozen door handles. Model 3s that would not charge in extreme cold, suggesting that they hadn't done much winter testing. Whereas, Audi takes 200 prototypes up to the Arctic Circle and bangs on them for three months, or something like that. These other companies -- in fact, Jaguar, before they rolled out the I-PACE, made a point of showing, ""We took a whole bunch of these cars to some snowy place and banged on them and had our engineers take notes of what needed to be improved."" That was properly understood, I think, as a shot at Tesla.

That's not necessarily what Consumer Reports is citing here, but it's all of a piece. They didn't fully develop this car before they released it. They improvised things on the production line that maybe don't work out to build vehicles of the quality that they hoped to deliver because they did this fast, they did this by the seat of their pants because they wanted to show people they're innovative, they wanted to show people that they're manufacturing on a different level from ordinary regular automakers, that they can do things faster, that they can execute faster, and so forth. And the result is, the windows will crack because of the way they're installed, or because they cheaped out with a supplier or didn't fully develop the bracket that supports it, or something. Etc, etc, etc. These are the kinds of problems that come up when they didn't fully develop the vehicle and didn't draw on their understanding of what works and what doesn't based on extensive industry experience and so forth. It's the same thing.

Sciple: Right, John. In the past, Tesla had run afoul of Consumer Reports when it came to braking issues with the Model 3. They had been able to correct those with over-the-air software updates to the vehicle. What's important to note here when you're looking at issues with cracking glass and sticking door handles and things like that, those are things you cannot correct via an over-the-air software update. Those are things that are mechanical and take repairs. Another thing to note as well is, when you have these reliability issues, those repair expenses become factored into your insurance expense. When you're going for the mass market with this $35,000 Model 3, insurance expense becomes part of the total cost of ownership of the vehicle. Something to be aware of as we go to this mass market. It's not just a $35,000 vehicle, but it's a $35,000 vehicle with an above-market insurance expense. What do you think about that, John?

Rosevear: I think there's another factor too, here. With your $35,000 BMW 3 series, there is an expectation that when it breaks, you can bring it to the BMW dealer and they will get parts and fix it promptly. We've had report after report after report -- including from one of our own Fool writers, Evan Niu, had this experience himself -- -where people have waited months and months for parts from Tesla, parts that another automaker would have in the shop within a few days. That's another thing with the mass-market experience. Maybe with your Ferrari, you're willing to wait a month for the gasket piece needed to put the whole thing back together. The expectations around a $100,000 car that is a third car for somebody are very different from the expectations around a $35,000 car that somebody needs to get to work every day. It can't be in the shop for six weeks waiting for a part.

Sciple: Right. One thing I want to mention, and Elon Musk mentions this a lot, and Tesla calls it out, that despite these issues, Tesla still holds the top spot at the Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey. They're really driving significant customer satisfaction. When you look at that, that Consumer Reports is highlighting reliability issues with the vehicle, yet consumer satisfaction is still extremely high, what are your thoughts on that? How should investors think about that?

Rosevear: That the cars that top the consumer satisfaction survey are not always the cars that are reliable. I mean, the Prius ends up on these lists because the people who buy Prius cars really, really love Prius cars. Do you ever see a Corolla on this kind of list? No, you won't. You're going to see cars that people love that have enthusiast communities. The Jeep Wrangler, the Chevrolet Corvette, things like the Dodge Challenger. These are not necessarily -- they could be, but not necessarily -- paragons of reliability. I mean, I owned a Vet for a while. It was fun, but GM spent less money developing that than they do on a pickup truck, and it showed sometimes. [laughs] I mean, anybody who's ever had a Corvette knows what I'm talking about. It comes with a certain expectation that not everything is going to work 100% of the time. It's that it's going to be a little more of an edgy product and not so much with the Toyota reliability. But these are often the vehicles that get enthusiast followings. Jeeps have a tremendous enthusiast following. The Dodge muscle cars have a tremendous enthusiast following. Corvettes -- and, not always high-performance cars. Like I said, the Prius has a tremendous, devoted enthusiast following, as does Tesla. We all know, spend 15 minutes reading about Tesla on Twitter and you will understand, if you don't already: Tesla people really, really, really, really love their cars. That's great! That's fine. That doesn't mean they're reliable. It doesn't comment on reliability at all. It comments that the car, the brand, is delivering something that these people find deeply satisfying.

Sciple: Right, John. I think if you're going to own a position in this company, you have to be betting on this brand being extremely strong despite the issues that we've cited throughout the past year. That people love this car so much that that they're willing to deal with some of the issues that come with owning the vehicle. Do you want to comment on that, John?

Rosevear: I do. I want to say, the flip side of that is, the Chevy Corvette is not a mass-market offering, despite its high customer satisfaction levels. That isn't what's going to drive that business. The investment case for Tesla is that these become mass-market vehicles. If you have to be a hardcore enthusiast to have one, that's not going to do it. Cars like Camrys end up on these lists, but those are the cars that millions of people depend on to get to work every morning. If that's where Tesla wants to go -- or, if we're going to take an upscale of it, BMW 3 series. Plenty of BMW owners love, love, love their cars and will evangelize them to great length. Plenty of other BMW owners just bought it because it was a nice car, it made sense, they got a good deal that day, they drive it to work every day, and they expect it to work for 120,000 miles or whatever. It's that latter group that makes up most new car sales. It's that latter group that Tesla's has to break into to get anywhere near the sales assumptions that are baked into its stock price. This high customer satisfaction thing says nothing about their chances to do that. In fact, what it tells me is they haven't yet broken beyond the early adopter enthusiast hardcore. Of the people answering Consumer Reports survey who owned a Tesla, some big majority of them are extreme Tesla enthusiasts. You've got to look at the cause and effect here and what that says about where Tesla is in the marketplace right now.

Sciple: Sure. John, the other story I want to talk about is what's going on with full self-driving with Tesla. Just yesterday, Tesla made some relatively significant changes to its website with how it markets its autopilot and full self-driving offering. On the autopilot front, they added some language saying ""current autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous."" The more significant changes came in the full self-driving area, where they changed language saying that ""all Tesla vehicles have the hardware necessary for full self-driving"" to ""new Tesla cars have the hardware for full self-driving."" By implication, does this suggests that older Tesla vehicles won't be capable of the full self-driving that Musk has been promising going all the way back three, four years? That these early Model 3s and things like that would be able to enjoy full self-driving as Tesla rolled out those capabilities?

Rosevear: I think people who have made some effort to understand what this technology is and isn't, and what is really required to do it, have assumed for some time that these cars that rolled out with all this hardware were going to need some retrofit to actually get past level two or so, what they can do today.

There are big questions. Tesla believes they can do this without LIDAR sensors. They're pretty much alone and the entire industry -- both cutting-edge start-up people and people at automakers -- they're pretty much alone in thinking that. LIDAR units are expensive. Are they going to retrofit them? How is that going to work? And even if they don't, it now seems very likely that the earlier cars that were sold with this promise are going to need an upgrade in computing power. At minimum, that says Tesla has to recall them all and put the bigger computer brain in for this promise to be delivered on. How much is that going to cost? When is that going to happen? Where's the cash going to come from for it? Etc, etc. These issues have been lingering out there a little below the surface for a while, but this brings them back up.

A little bit separately, what all these changes to the language on the site tell me is that somebody in the legal department finally looked at this. This is the thing that happens when you're drafting the site, when you show it to the lawyers. [laughs] This has been out there for a while, so maybe as part of their corporate governance changes that the board is maybe now belatedly trying to install, counsel took a look at this and said, ""Wait, we have to back way off this. This is massive exposure and we can do it right now."" Maybe it was the German regulators' actions that brought it to their attention. Something happened. This is not just routine cleaning up the site over the course of business. Something drove this.

Sciple: Two other things to call out as well. They've eliminated language on the site saying ""we believe full self-driving will be at least twice as good as a human driver,"" also backed off claims on the capability and ability to roll out the vehicle, saying, ""the future use of these features without supervision is dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience."" Of course, that by implication leads to believe that the sample size of data available to the company needs to be significantly larger than it is today for those capabilities to exist.

You mentioned interventions by regulators perhaps prompting this. We've seen the NHTSA and the NTSB reopen investigations into Tesla related to some fatal crashes that took place in Florida. Just in the past couple of weeks, we had the second instance of a fatal crash. There had been a previous occurrence of this wreck, and then another one with a separate driver, where the driver of the vehicle was driving down a divided highway where a semi was crossing the two lanes of the divided highway, and the vehicle passed underneath the car, cutting the car in half, killing the driver. This is the second iteration of this sort of accident. We don't know what happened with this current accident. The previous accident, autopilot had been engaged. We do know that for this more recent accident, the car continued driving for an additional third of a mile after the wreck had occurred.

This also occurs at a time where the NHTSA has received some widespread criticism about the data it used to say that autopilot in the previous crash had actually been reasonably safe. That data had claimed that autopilot reduced crash rates by 40%. However, after a multi-year Freedom of Information Act case, Quality Control Systems Corp got access to the underlying data that the NHTSA had used to reach those conclusions and was able to determine that the data was flawed and could not be relied upon.

So, as we see regulators again taking a look at Tesla's autopilot, we see repeated fatal crashes with the same characteristics, is there a chance that these changes across Tesla's website are related to this latest action from Highway Safety regulators in the U.S.?

Rosevear: Sure. This is the new lawyer in the legal department seeing this happen and being like, ""OK, we have to tighten this up right now."" They may not have heard a word yet from the regulators around this, but this is battening down the hatches. This is probably some lawyer having a fit that this language was on the site, and saying, ""This should never have gone on the site. We should have done this years ago. What happened here? We have to tighten this way down. You can't be promising this stuff because people are getting killed and hurt.""

Sciple: Sure. And then, talking about other promises Tesla has made related to autopilot and self-driving, Elon Musk appeared on a podcast with ARK Invest, which has a major holding in Tesla and has a $4,000 price target on the stock. As part of that interview, Elon said that full self-driving will be feature-complete by the end of 2019, essentially will be safer than a human driver, able to be used without intervention, merely dependent on regulator approval. Given these changes across the website, can we still depend on that guidance Elon gave to ARK Invest and the listeners to that podcast?

Rosevear: Feature-complete is such an interesting phrase, isn't it? You could argue that GM's Cruise automation system is feature-complete, and that all the features are there, it just needs a lot of on-road time to learn and develop and, through machine learning, become more skillful to the point where GM trusts it to be level four and releases it, something they hope will happen this year. We'll see. GM is pointedly not saying that.

It is possible that what Tesla means is, ""We'll be ready to begin that aggressive driverless on-road testing process to accumulate all those miles so that we can release this as level four eventually."" I don't know what it means. I don't think anybody knows what it means. It sounds like the kind of thing you say when you want to imply a promise that you're not quite ready to make. [laughs] I don't know! What does Tesla know that everyone else doesn't? I don't know that they know anything that anybody else doesn't. I know that people who know much, much more about the state of this technology than I do think Tesla is somewhat behind, rather than out in front. I think there are partisans who would dispute that. But there's no clear evidence that Tesla is way out in front -- maybe I should say, nobody but its most ardent fans and investors assumes as Tesla is out on the front of self-driving. The pecking order, as widely discussed across the industry, is that Waymo is in first place, GM Cruise is in second place, and then there's a gap to third place. There's something of a gap between Waymo and GM, too. Waymo got started a lot earlier. That's how things are going to unfold.

And yet, you have these people saying that only Tesla has self-driving, etc etc etc. It speaks to the misperceptions underpinning the bull case for this stock.

Sciple: I think if we're going to place Tesla's autonomous capability along the commonly accepted scale from zero to level five autonomy, Tesla's more in the range of level two or level three autonomy today, vs. --

Rosevear: They're squarely level two. They have not released anything -- the definition of level three is kind of muddy, but I think if you asked Tesla at a moment where their legal department was in the room, they would not claim anything beyond level two. They never have, really, when you nail them down on it.

Sciple: Right. For our listeners, when we think of full self-driving, you hop in the car, you go to sleep in the driver's seat, the car shows up at your work or wherever you're trying to go without you having to intervene, that's a level four autonomous system. That's a big leap. That's what Waymo and GM Cruise are trying to develop. For those capabilities, it's commonly accepted, at least today, that those have to be in a limited, geo-fenced area where you have really robust mapping technology, and you have to use LIDAR to make that possible. None of that is part of Tesla's offering.

As we see them back off some autonomous claims, something to keep in mind as we look forward at the business, Tesla does cite its autonomous data has been very valuable to them and doing machine learning and building out their capabilities. We'll just have to see. Any final thoughts on that, John?

Rosevear: No. I mean, we just have to see. I tend to think that, because of errors made over the last few years, and course changes and so forth, somewhat related to Elon's style, that Tesla went from a position of being somewhat out in front to being behind. They have some good talent working on this problem. I don't know that they have enough talent. I don't know that they have enough resources. I don't know that the talent has a clear enough picture of what they're realistically charged with doing here. It's a big puzzle. Right now, Tesla is a level two system. Where it goes from here, and when, well, Elon says stuff.

You could really sum up much of what we've said in this very long podcast by ""Elon says stuff, and sometimes it's not what happens."" [laughs] You know? ""Elon makes decisions on the fly, and sometimes he doesn't have all the information."" That's Tesla, right there. [laughs]

Sciple: Yeah. I want to wrap all this together, John. The narrative here, as we said off the top of the show, Tesla has been really successful in building, from a standing start at zero, a really significant global automaker. To do that, you really have to have guts and nerve, and you have to not believe any of the challenges that are in front of you, that you can overcome all those things. That's what Elon is really great at. He's been able to build this automaker to a really important global brand. As you mentioned, changed the narrative around electric vehicles.

However, there's always a point in time where what got you where you are is not going to get you where you need to go. In investing, to make a lot of money in the stock market, you need to be concentrated; but to stay wealthy, you need to be diversified. To become a very big, important automaker, you have to have that nerve and that I-can-do-anything mentality; but to exist over a long period of time, you have to ride these cycles, you have to be prudent and cautious in how you roll things out. The question that you've got to ask if you're going to invest in this company is, is the way Tesla operates its business going to become more stable over the long term? Or, can we expect this continued volatility and flying by the seat of your pants and those sorts of things? What are your thoughts on that, John? And, just thoughts on Tesla moving forward?

Rosevear: It's Elon. It's all Elon. Elon has made himself Tesla. He has made himself the person who gets to make all the decisions. He has made himself the person without whom important decisions can't be made. He's lost a lot of his executive talent over the last few years. I mean, the departure list is so long that if we read it on the air, that would be a whole nother podcast. [laughs] He's lost a lot of his executive talent because if Elon's running everything, why am I here? Over and over. So, it's on him. As long as Elon is calling the shots, this company is going to be Elon's company. It's going to be quick-to-pivot, it's going to be mercurial, it's going to be maybe making decisions without the benefit of full information and careful contemplation of alternatives. It's going to be making claims that are more aspirational than realistic. It's going to be setting goals that are more to motivate people than to actually be achieved. And so on, and so on. It's all this stuff we've talked about here today.

I think where we end up is, what happens to Tesla depends on Elon. And Elon isn't going to change into Alan Mulally overnight. He's just not. Or any of the other executives we have admired in the auto industry over the years. He's just not. He is who he is at this point. The guy is almost 50 years old. He's been using this approach for years. It's gotten him an awful long way. At some point, he has to offload responsibility, or have it taken away from him by his board or by regulators, if Tesla is to get anywhere near the promise built into its market value today.

Sciple: Sure, yeah. John, full disclosure, I own puts on this company. I don't think it's going to take place. I think this company is really starting to show some strain as they've had to change their business model. Baillie Gifford, one of the largest holders of Tesla, has advocated for Elon taking a step back from active management of the company, kind of like how Jeff Bezos does, where he's not on conference calls and things like that. I don't have strong prospects for that taking place. In any event, there is zero chance that Elon will stop being CEO of this company. The really robust compensation package that Tesla's board put in place for Elon last year requires him to receive his compensation to either be Executive Chairman and Chief Product officer or CEO. He cannot be executive chairman for the next three years because of the SEC's settlement that was reached back in late summer. So, Elon is going to be CEO, to stay. As you mentioned, his personality is not going to change. He's almost a 50-year-old man. We'll see what happens.

Rosevear: We should say, he's not going to leave voluntarily. There are scenarios, including a DNO ban from the SEC, or action of his board of directors, which has so far been essentially his rubber stamp. But, who knows? At some point, they have to be aware of their own responsibilities. If this thing starts to really slip and they're exposed, they may feel the urgent need to take decisive action. We don't know. There's nothing saying that they have to keep him as CEO, even if he really wants to be kept as CEO. There really is uncertainty around this. He's not going to leave willingly, most likely. It's possible he'll say, ""Alright, I'm done. I'm going to go play SpaceX."" I don't know. But, his unquestioned control of Tesla would seem to be the obstacle to Tesla reaching the heights to which its investors expect it to reach eventually.

Sciple: Sure. John, really thankful having you on! So much news to break down. For our listeners who have made it to the end, thank you for riding with us this hour and a half. So much to talk about with Tesla. Before we go away, John, as we look out the rest of this year, what are you going to be watching most closely out of this company? And what should investors be paying attention to?

Rosevear: What I'm going to be watching most closely is the progress of this factory in Shanghai. What's really going on with the Model Y, what does it look like, what are they expectations around it, where are they going to build it? And, what's the cash level? [laughs] How much money do they really have? Is it enough?

Sciple: We'll find out soon, I'm sure. I follow this company on Twitter every single day. I'm going to keep following it. I'm sure we'll talk about it here soon because this company can't avoid the news. I'll really be looking forward to continue to talk about it with you, John. Thanks for coming on!

261,0.9965,0.123,0.821,0.056,"There were already signs that all was not well at Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) SolarCity subsidiary, way back in early 2017. In the first quarter after Elon Musk closed on the automaker's purchase of the solar installer, the company reported a number of problems, including shrinking cash flows, lower-than-expected gross margin, and the need for cost-cutting.

A number of developments since then have brought the solar installer closer and closer to oblivion. But the March 1 announcement that the company will close most of its stores may be the final nail in SolarCity's coffin. Here's why, and why it may not matter much for Tesla or its investors.

Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Tesla.

A bright sunshiny day

Just five short years ago, in 2014, SolarCity -- then a separate company -- was the top solar installer in the country. Its unique business model involved installing a solar system on a home for free, but retaining the system's ownership and selling the electricity it produced to the homeowner at a much lower rate than the local utility. This freed the homeowner from the massive up-front costs of a solar installation, and allowed SolarCity to have a growing recurring revenue stream.

However, the price of solar panels and solar systems rapidly began to get cheaper, which didn't do SolarCity's sales model any favors. In early 2017, SolarCity -- now acquired by Tesla for $2.9 billion in stock and the assumption of $2 billion of SolarCity's debt -- stopped selling solar panels door-to-door, and that same year lost its top installer crown to Sunrun.

Tesla tried a number of things to boost sales, most notably partnering with Home Depot in February 2018 to sell SolarCity products in kiosks in about 800 of Home Depot's roughly 2,200 stores. Musk pulled the plug on that collaboration in June 2018, just four months after it launched, which was odd because Home Depot reportedly accounted for about half of SolarCity sales.

Musk explained that he wanted to ""focus ... on selling solar power in Tesla stores and online."" But clearly, that's no longer the plan.

An abrupt about-face

In the company's Q4 2018 update letter -- which was released on Jan. 30 of this year -- Musk was still clearly envisioning Tesla stores as the primary sales venue for the company's solar products. ""We are still in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners [read: Home Depot] to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles,"" he wrote.

But then, just over a month later, Musk announced the company would close most of those stores -- and, presumably, lay off most of that ""sales team"" -- in order to offer the long-awaited $35,000 version of the Model 3. According to Musk, offering sales only online and by phone would shave 6% off the cost of each vehicle -- and that's not chump change.

That would leave Tesla's website as the lone source for solar installation sales. Right now, the only sales opportunity on the site is a ""Request a Custom Quote"" button on the energy page that takes you to a half-page form collecting name and contact info. ""Don't call us; we'll call you"" has never been a particularly strong sales technique. Now, it's possible that this feature will become more robust once the Tesla stores close and the company ramps up online sales in general, but I'm not holding my breath.

Why it may not matter

First of all, the name ""SolarCity"" is, for all intents and purposes, already dead. It doesn't appear anywhere on Tesla's website, except in archived press releases and reports. The company's solar panel and solar roof installations, as well as its PowerWall and PowerPack energy storage units, are listed in financial statements as ""Energy Generation and Storage,"" and on the website as just ""Energy.""

Surprisingly, Tesla's energy sales have actually been growing like gangbusters. Revenue grew at an impressive 39.3% in 2018, to $1.6 billion, and gross margin was up 604 basis points year over year to a decent 11.7% in Q4. Of course, that's a pittance compared to the company's $18.5 billion in 2018 automotive revenue, and automotive's 24.3% gross margin, but it's still solid growth.

The big reason these numbers are so positive is thanks to ""a substantial growth in energy storage deployments,"" according to Tesla's Q4 2018 update. Meaning it's the energy storage part of the business -- as opposed to the generation part -- that's powering its growth. Indeed, in the letter, the listed primary growth opportunities were for PowerWall energy storage in Australia and Europe, and large-scale battery projects across the globe. Tesla doesn't break out its energy sales by product, but it seems a sure bet that they're declining...and probably rapidly.

What it all means

Tesla's primary focus is -- and should be -- manufacturing cars. Its automotive division is responsible for 86.3% of company revenue, while energy only contributes 7.2% (the rest is ""services and other""). It's unclear how much of that 7.2% comes from solar panel installation, but the primary growth segment for Tesla Energy is energy storage, not solar generation.

So even though the main avenue for solar system sales is about to be cut off, neither investors nor the market may even notice, let alone care. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if Tesla quietly ended its solar installations altogether, at least until it's worked the kinks out of its experimental Solar Roof technology.

In the meantime, investors should focus instead on Tesla's automotive strategy and performance, because unlike SolarCity, that's what will make or break the company."

(TSLA - Free Report) has made the announcement of inking a deal with lenders in China to obtain 12-month facility of up to 3.5 billion yuan ($521 million) for its Gigafactory in Shanghai, per Reuters. Lenders in the deal include China Construction Bank Corp., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. This credit facility will place this electric vehicle (“EV”) maker a step closer to the production of its flagship Model 3 sedan at its first overseas facility.
After prolonged negotiations with the China authorities, Tesla got the nod to own the first wholly-owned foreign manufacturing facility in the country and broke ground on the Shanghai factory in January 2019. The Gigafactory will cost approximately $2 billion and it is likely to be completed in May 2019.
A wholly-owned manufacturing factory will be hugely beneficial for the company. This will aid it in lowering the impact of the U.S.-China trade spat. Moreover, this will help the company to compete with a fleet of EV startups.

263,0.9726,0.047,0.946,0.007,"Audi AG (OTC:AUDV.F) took the wraps off its latest electric model at the Geneva Motor Show on Tuesday. The Audi e-tron Q4 Concept is a preview of a compact all-electric crossover SUV that the company expects to put into production next year.

This could be a big deal. By showing the Q4 Concept now, Audi establishes a baseline that the 800-pound gorilla of electric-car mindshare, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), will have to match or beat when it presents its Model Y compact crossover later this month.

Here's what we know.

What it is: An upscale electric crossover SUV

If you know your Audis, you might have guessed from its name that the e-tron Q4 Concept is a two-row electric crossover SUV one size down from Audi's first premium electric SUV, the e-tron.

It's a dual-motor all-wheel-drive design with an 82 kilowatt-hour battery pack that seems to be optimized for range rather than ""ludicrous"" acceleration. Audi said the e-tron Q4 Concept will accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour) in 6.3 seconds -- reasonably quick, but not Tesla-quick. But it will have a rated range of over 450 kilometers (about 280 miles) on the new, strict WLTP European test standard, the company said.

Inside, the vehicle's long wheelbase (and the flat floor that its electric drivetrain allows) gives it more space than its exterior dimensions would suggest. In what is becoming a trend with electric vehicles, Audi selected sustainable materials for the e-tron Q4 Concept's interior: Painted trim rather than chrome, recycled materials in the carpet, and seats upholstered in Alcantara (a suede-like microfiber fabric) instead of leather.

Interestingly, it doesn't share the bigger e-tron's underpinnings. Instead, it'll be the first Audi to be built on corporate parent Volkswagen AG 's (OTC:VLKA.Y) MEB architecture, a modular set of components designed to be shared widely among the company's electric vehicles in an effort to reduce costs and time to market. That should make the production version more profitable for Audi, more cost-competitive, or both.

Audi said that it will launch the production version of the e-tron Q4 in the second half of 2020.

Why it's important: Audi is tackling Tesla head-on

Sorry, Tesla fans, this isn't vaporware. Believe it or not, the production version of the Q4 e-tron Concept will be Audi's fifth battery-electric model when it arrives in 2020. It'll follow the original e-tron crossover SUV (first deliveries later this month), the e-tron Sportback (due later this year), a smaller crossover called the e-tron Q2L that was designed specifically for China (also due later this year), and the high-performance e-tron GT sports sedan (due in 2020). By 2025, Audi plans to have 12 all-electric models in production covering ""every relevant market segment from the compact class to the luxury class."" It expects that electric models will account for about a third of its global sales by that time.

Of more immediate import, Audi has now thrown a gauntlet. This is a close preview of the vehicle it will use to challenge Tesla's Model Y, starting late next year. Tesla might have its small crossover SUV in production sooner, but potential Model Y buyers now know that Audi will have something in the same class -- something with a nice interior and a dealer network that can get parts in days rather than months, something that will be fully tested prior to launch -- before long.

Who's disrupting who? We'll see."

CEOs come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are conservative and try to shy away from too much exposure and are careful about what they say. Then there are some whose actions and words can have a significant impact on the performance of their company's share price.

Zuckerberg and Congress

In April 2018, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to testify in front of the U.S. Congress in relation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

After news broke about this data scandal, over $100 billion was wiped off the market cap of Facebook in a matter of days. There were calls from all quarters to have social media platforms like Facebook reined in and face much tighter regulations.

Zuckerberg ended up giving 10 hours' worth of testimony. Showcasing the influence a CEO can have on stock fluctuation, investors reacted positively to his explanations and reassurances, with Facebook's market cap bouncing back by almost $23 billion.

Investors were able to watch Zuckerberg's testimony closely as it was televised, and were seemingly encouraged by his ability to apologize and outline protections to stop such a breach from happening again. During the televised testimony, Facebook's shares rose by 4.5%.

Branson and his hyping abilities

Richard Branson is well-known for his publicity stunts over the years, including attempting to make the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, trying to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon and driving a tank through Times Square in New York.

Branson has played around with the idea of space tourism for many years. Through Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE), this is now almost a reality. For a mere $250,000 you can get in line for a 90-minute space ride. Branson was able to beat Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX to the open market.

On the back of an extensive campaign from Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic became the first space tourism company to be publicly listed in October 2019.

Talking about the lure of investing in such a company, Branson said that if the ""public want to dabble a little bit in a spaceship company, own a little bit of a spaceship company, they can now do so.""

While the company has not been profitable to date, Branson has used his charisma to convince investors that this will change. He pronounces that Virgin Galactic will not be like other loss-making businesses that have gone public in recent years and struggled, such as Uber.

Branson announced that A-list celebrities such as singer Justin Bieber and actor Leonardo DiCaprio are ready to fly on one of the suborbital flights led by Virgin Galactic. The company also announced that Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) (NYSE:UA) is making the spacesuits, which Branson wore during the public launch and look like something out of Star Trek.

This initial hype saw its valuation soar to $2.3 billion as shares rose by nearly 10% after trading began, hitting a high of $12.93. However, when the Branson effect started to fade away and investors looked into the actual potential of the company, shares dropped by over 20% after a week of trading. After about a month of trading, the share price is down around the $7.25 range, representing a drop of about 44% since opening day highs. Therefore, for the company to have future success, it looks like Branson will have to deliver on his promise of profitability.

Elon Musk and his all-'round behavior

While Elon Musk is seen as a great visionary, bringing his companies Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX to fruition, his comments and actions have also made him a thorn in the side of his investors.

For some time, Musk's positive comments led to soaring share prices, but in more recent times, he's had the opposite effect.

Musk has never been one to shy away from making controversial comments, particularly through his Twitter account. A nine-word tweet from Musk in August 2018 -- ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" -- sparked mayhem for the next two months.

This was published at a time when the stock was trading at $370. As Musk was forecasting a 20% premium on the current price, investors flocked to buy the stock, with it soaring by over 8.5% shortly after.

However, this tweet began to backfire as people realized that the company would not be going private after all. Numerous lawsuits were filed against Musk, including one by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused him of making public false statements.

Musk appeared on the highly popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast in September 2018. During the show, he smoked marijuana on video, which contributed to Tesla's share price falling by 9%. These are but a couple of instances of Musk's words and actions getting Tesla into trouble.

Thankfully for investors, Musk has largely curtailed his controversial tweets of late."
265,-0.2966,0.066,0.86,0.074,"Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) latest electric vehicle, its futuristic stainless-steel Cybertruck, has left Wall Street and investors scratching their heads about its viability, but consumers appear to love it, with pre-orders already pouring in.

Late last week, in what some considered a bizarre display at Tesla's design studio outside Los Angeles, CEO Elon Musk unveiled the much-hyped pickup that he had been teasing for weeks. The Cybertruck gets 250 miles on a single charge and starts at just $39,900. Add any of the perks like dual engines and this new electric vehicle gets much pricier. The other two models, a dual-motor one and a tri-motor version, are priced at $49,900 and $69,900, respectively.

Musk took to Twitter since its launch to give an update on how pre-orders are faring in the days after the Cybertruck's debut. On Saturday (Nov. 22) Tesla sold 146,000 Cybertrucks with 42% of orders opting for the dual-engine model, 41% for the three-engine model, and 17% for the entry-level Cybertruck. That figure got updated by Musk on Sunday (Nov. 23) in a simple tweet: ""187K.""

It has since surpassed 250,000 orders. Analysts typically use pre-orders of Tesla vehicles to get a sense of how demand will shape up. With customers required to put $100 down, Tesla made more than $18 million. Those deposits are refundable and much lower than Tesla usually requires. Production for the Cybertruck is slated to kick-off at the end of 2021, with the tri-motor version going into production in 2022.

Investors aren't as impressed as superfans

While fans couldn't seem to get enough of the Cybertruck, industry watchers and investors were much more skeptical, causing the stock to end on the week the truck was announced on a down note. Vehicle reviewers and critics have been quick to call the Cybertruck a concept rather than a viable pickup truck. They question if it will ever be legal on U.S. streets and roadways, and predicted that the Cybertruck that hits the market will look different than the one Musk unveiled.

Critics point to everything from the missing mirrors and wipers to wheels and tires that don't look production viable. With a steering wheel better suited for a race car than a passenger vehicle, it's also not clear if the interior will get a bit of an overhaul as well.

Some Wall Street analysts also expressed concern about the impact the Cybertruck will have on the Model Y, Tesla's electric crossover that's expected to begin production in 2020. Production in China and Europe is slated for early 2021. When Tesla announced the Model Y, interest in that launch was overshadowed by worries that it would hurt sales of the Model 3 and that same concern was raised with the Model Y and the Cybertruck.

Competition looms large

Then there's competition from vehicle manufacturers that are working on their own electric trucks. Rivian, an electric-truck start-up out of Plymouth, Michigan, that counts Amazon.com and Ford (NYSE:F) as backers, is coming out with its own electric trucks next year that, while priced higher than the entry-level Cybertruck, have a much more familiar design to pickup truck owners. Ford, maker of the popular F-150 pickup truck, is expected to launch an electric version in 2021, while General Motors (NYSE:GM) is rumored to be working on its own electric pickup truck.

While there is a lot of hype surrounding the Cybertruck, it's not a reason for investors to increase their position in Tesla. After all, despite its ability to churn out new vehicles that get Twitter abuzz its stock hasn't been able to outperform. This year alone Tesla has had a surprise profit, completed its Shanghai plant ahead of schedule and came out with a futuristic-looking truck, yet its shares are trading lower. That compares to the S&P 500 which is 23% higher.

Investors clearly weren't impressed with the Cybertruck and Wall Street analysts are mixed about the impact it will have on Tesla's earnings, but fans of the electric-vehicle maker say critics are missing the bigger picture. They are hung up on design and are ignoring the big news, the $39,900 price tag. They say its a commendable feat given that EVs have long been priced higher, and a testament to Tesla's improving manufacturing. But whether or not that will be a reality is another question that should weigh on investors. Tesla had boasted about a $35,000 Model 3 but that has yet to happen, with the Model 3 priced at $39,000.

With the Cybertruck a production line nightmare in its current state, investors are right to be skeptical about Tesla's ability to deliver on the price and design. Ultimately the success of the Cybertruck will depend on what comes rolling off the production line when it is ready for its prime-time debut."
266,0.9843,0.104,0.828,0.068,"Electric vehicles (EVs) have been the next big thing in transportation for nearly a decade, but they're still a bit player in the auto market. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, despite 63% year-over-year growth, EVs were just 2.2% of the global auto market in 2018.

In 2020, the momentum in electric vehicles may reach a new level, and once they get rolling, they will be hard to stop. Not only is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) expected to have another big year with Model Y deliveries expected to start, but General Motors (NYSE:GM), Kia, Hyundai, Audi (OTC:AUDV.F), Porsche (OTC:POAH.Y), and many more will also introduce or expand their range of EVs.

And these offerings aren't tiptoeing into the market, as we've seen in the past. There will be compelling, long-range, affordable vehicles available for customers next year. The EV market may finally be something to take seriously.

Range anxiety is almost gone

The first hindrance EVs faced was anxiety that drivers would be stranded miles from a charging station. Cross-country drives or even long road trips were once unthinkable with an electric drivetrain, especially when early vehicles had ranges of less than 100 miles.

Range anxiety isn't completely gone, but today it shouldn't be any harder to drive an EV a long distance than a conventional vehicle. Many have ranges of over 250 miles on a single charge, and the charging infrastructure across the U.S. is accessible almost anywhere. According to German website Statista, there are 20,000 charging locations and 57,000 charging plugs across the U.S. That's still fewer than the 150,000 gas stations across the country, but remember that EVs can also be charged at home.

With a little planning, almost any drive is possible, and that'll open up the market to once-skeptical consumers.

Options are abundant

For years, Tesla was the only company that took EVs seriously from a real-world functionality standpoint. It had more range than competitors, better styling, and a better charging network. Chevy entered the mix with the Bolt, but sales have stagnated around 20,000 units per year and may fall in the U.S. for the second straight year in 2019, so it hasn't been the competitor some hoped it would be.

But 2020's slate of vehicles are finally ready to be taken seriously. First, the charging network for non-Teslas is arguably now better than Tesla's network, with more plugs across the country, so charging isn't a hindrance. But where competitors are really catching up is in style and range. They're finally learning from Tesla's success and introducing some compelling offerings.

Kia is making a splash in EVs with the e-Soul, with up to 280 miles in advertised range, and the Niro (239 miles). Starting at $34,000 and $38,500, respectively, these two could attract the budget-conscious buyer.

The Hyundai Kona Electric starts at $36,500 and is said to get 258 miles of range out of its compact hatchback design, which is competitive in styling, price, and range.

The top end of the market is getting some very interesting options. Audi says its e-tron has 204 miles of range, and it has fairly standard SUV styling. It's not cheap, starting at $74,800, but Audi SUVs attract a well-heeled buyer to begin with, so this may add a niche to the EV market.

The Porsche Taycan is aimed squarely at the Tesla Model S with 256 miles of range, a 0-to-60 time that can be under 3 seconds, and a starting price of $103,800. It's designed to be the most impressive sport EV on the market and could steal some of the thunder from the Model S. This is not a car for everyone, but it'll certainly bring buzz to the EV market.

EVs are more attractive than ever

The list of EVs above is far from exhaustive, but it gives a peek at how the offerings in the market are improving. It's no longer a choice between Tesla's expensive, long-range vehicles or a short-range, poorly styled car; there are lots of options. Cars, SUVs, budget vehicles, and luxury brands are all going to be well represented in the EV market next year.

If consumers get over their range anxiety and start to embrace the superior performance and cost-effectiveness of EVs, the market may explode in 2020 and start to take a formidable share of auto sales."
267,0.9911,0.104,0.867,0.029,"Two years ago, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) did the (seemingly) impossible.

CEO Elon Musk made a personal promise to Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes to complete a 100-megawatt (129 megawatt-hour) superbattery in just 100 days -- or Tesla would do the work for free. Then he did exactly that.

As a result, for the past two years, South Australia has benefited from the ""Tesla Big Battery"" (TBB).

Australia's Sydney Morning Herald reports that since Tesla completed its battery warehouse, blackouts in the region have become ""vanishingly rare."" They're not entirely unheard of, however. In January 2019, for example, SA Power Networks was forced to apologize to its customers for a 25,000-home blackout. A record heat wave had strained the electrical grid's capacity despite help from Musk.

And so...Tesla is expanding its battery warehouse.

50% more power

As French renewable energy company Neoen announced last week, it has contracted with Tesla to effect ""a 50 per cent expansion of the world's largest battery, Hornsdale Power Reserve, also known as the Tesla Big Battery.""

In order to both address the continued blackout problem and ""further showcase the complete benefits that grid-scale batteries can provide to the National Electricity Market (NEM) and Australian consumers,"" Neoen will have Tesla install a further 50 megawatts' (64.5 megawatt-hours) worth of Tesla Powerpacks at the power warehouse, with expansion set to be complete in the first half of 2020.

What it means for Australia

In Neoen's press release, the company notes that usage of the TBB has already saved consumers some 50 million Australian dollars. Neoen doesn't clarify whether these are savings from what would have been spent to generate electricity from hydrocarbon fuels, from decreased grid downtime, or some combination of the two.

Expanding the TBB, says Neoen, will generate additional savings for consumers and provide ""additional power system reliability."" The company also hopes to demonstrate that a large enough power warehouse can add a form of ""inertia"" to the region's power stream. Under a grid experiencing strain, the hope is that by the time the TBB is drained, other parts of the grid will already be back up and running -- preventing what could have been a blackout from actually happening.

What it means for Tesla

Such a demonstration would probably be good news for Tesla's power business as well -- and not a moment too soon. As Tesla has focused its efforts this past year on getting the kinks worked out of its Model 3 electric car production system, you see, growth at the company's much smaller energy generation and storage business (which used to be SolarCity) has sort of stalled.

Through the first nine months of 2019, S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows, sales at Tesla's flagship automotive division have surged 23% to $16.1 billion. Energy generation sales, on the other hand, have slipped 7.5% to just $1.1 billion.

Granted, expanding the TBB alone won't be enough to reverse this trend. According to Neoen's press release, the South Australian government will only be paying about AU$15 million to subsidize the expansion of TBB over the next five years. Even with a further AU$8 million in subsidies from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and even assuming Neoen kicks in some cash of its own, that won't drop a lot of loot to Tesla's bottom line.

AU$23 million is only about $15.6 million, after all. And the entire cost of the original TBB was reported to max out at about $50 million, implying that a 50% expansion might generate perhaps $25 million in revenue for Tesla.

But as a test case that could potentially prove the ability of a megabattery power warehouse to prevent blackouts...entirely? This project could prove invaluable to Tesla, restoring growth to its energy storage business and potentially making its batteries more attractive than ever to the green energy movement."
268,0.9837,0.086,0.872,0.042,"There aren't many companies as divisive as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and there aren't many Tesla products as divisive as the newly unveiled cybertruck. The audacious design, which CEO Elon Musk admits was inspired by the sci-fi film Blade Runner and James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, looks more like a vehicle made for the invasion of some alien planet, not to haul equipment around suburban America.

While many on social media slammed the bold design and taunted the company over its botched unveiling (see below), many are still enthusiastic about the truck's out-of-the-box look and impressive specs. Here's the good, bad, and the ugly regarding all things cybertruck.

Starting with the ugly

At first, Tesla's shares were down some 6% on the day following the cybertruck reveal, as many major publications ridiculed both the design and unveiling. A Forbes editorial called it "" Ugly as Sin."" Even CNN noted that The cybertruck had become ""the butt of every internet joke.""

It didn't help that during the unveiling, Musk's lead designer, Franz von Holzhausen, attempted to demonstrate the toughness of the cybertruck's windows, only to subsequently smash them. Musk later blamed the prior ""door test"" for the snafu, where von Holzhausen took a sledgehammer to the driver's side door, which the door defended quite well. Musk later tweeted that the door test had actually cracked the driver's side window frame prior to the window test with the steel ball.

Of course, that doesn't explain why the back window then smashed as well.

The spec goodness

If one can get past the loud design and unveiling slipup, there were actually some very impressive specs on the new vehicle.

Data source: Tesla.com/cybertruck.

As is the case with Tesla's other models, the company is offering discounted self-driving features for $7,000, with the price set to increase in the future once the feature is legally available via software upgrade.

The above specs compare favorably against the country's most popular pickup, the Ford (NYSE:F) F-150. The 2020 F-150 models go for between $28,495 to $52,740, lower than the cybertruck's $39,900-$69,900 range. But remember, Teslas also generate a lot of fuel savings -- and that's especially true for large trucks. In addition, Tesla has a history of lowering prices as batteries become cheaper and production more efficient.

The cybertruck also appears to outdo the F-150 on certain specs. The tri-motor cybertruck's 3,500 lbs. of payload capacity and max towing capacity of 14,000+ lbs. slightly outshines the F-150's 3,270 lbs. and 13,200 lbs., respectively.

On a final positive note, despite the naysaying from social media, Musk tweeted that by the end of the weekend following the presentation, Tesla had already received 200,000 preorders. If those numbers do turn into sales, it would be impressive, enough by themselves to garner sixth place in U.S. pickup truck sales, according to JD Power. That would be just ahead of the GMC Sierra at 158,284 units sold and just behind the Toyota Tacoma at 245,659 units sold in the U.S. in 2018.

The bad, or at least issues to work through

While the cybertruck has much going for it, investors need may to ""kick the tires"" a bit more beyond the initial presentation, so to speak, as there could be a few holes in management's story.

First, Tesla's promotional tug-o-war video displaying the cybertruck's superiority over the Ford F-150 may have been flawed, as it appears the cybertruck is not only heavier, but was facing off against a mid-range F-150 model with older tires and only rear-wheel drive activated, as opposed to all-wheel drive.

Sundeep Madra, VP of Ford X, Ford's next-gen technology incubator, subsequently challenged Musk to send a cybertruck over so that Ford can conduct an ""apples-to-apples"" test -- which Musk promptly accepted. The new test may still work out in Tesla's favor, but investors and customers shouldn't necessarily bank on the cybertruck's superiority until more tests are done, hopefully one day by an independent judge.

The 200,000 preorders may also be a bit misleading as any type of leading indicator. Preorders for the cybertruck are only $100 and fully refundable, so it isn't as if these sales are totally bankable. By comparison, the preorder for the Model 3 was $1,000, and for the upcoming Model Y, it's $2,500. So, it's not like putting a preorder down is a huge commitment for the cybertruck.

Therefore, some of the hard numbers -- such as specs and preorders -- are still questionable at this point. Pickup drivers also tend to be more suburban and rural, and it's still unclear whether they will shed their loyalty for traditional models for the space-age design of the cybertruck.

Whether the cybertruck turns into a significant revenue driver for Tesla is still an open question, but one thing's for sure: It's sparking conversation, and there will be plenty of commentary from bulls and bears alike for this disruptive automaker over the next few years."
269,0.9961,0.101,0.876,0.024,"Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is trying to steal Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) thunder, unveiling an all-electric crossover, the first salvo in what is expected to be a battle for electric truck supremacy.

While the market for electric trucks, or cars for that matter, is still in its infancy, they are expected to explode as environmentally conscious consumers do their part to fight climate change. It doesn't hurt that consumers are in love with their trucks, SUVs, and crossovers, at least in the U.S.

According to J.D. Power, of new vehicles purchased, 71% fall in the truck, SUV, or crossover category, relegating cars to just 30% of the market. It behooves car manufacturers to churn out new trucks, including electric ones, given they typically have higher average selling prices and better margins than passenger vehicles.

Electric trucks aren't going to move the needle much for Ford or its stock in the early days, but the move signals its willingness to innovate and throw down with the likes of Tesla, which has long been the leader in electric vehicles.

The situation may be more precarious for Tesla depending on which camp you fall in. While it holds the leadership position right now, rivals are circling, and it's not just start-ups like Rivian, which Ford is backing. Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM), and a host of other car manufacturers are eyeing the electric truck market as one of the next bastions of growth.

Ford's Mustang inspiration may resonate with customers

Despite the competition, what makes Ford's all-electric truck stand out is that it has its roots in the iconic Mustang, something scores of consumers are familiar with. It wasn't always supposed to be that way, but Jason Castriota, Ford's global brand director, said in a recent interview that it went back to the drawing board, inspired by the Mustang after consumer feedback on its other iterations of an all-electric car failed to inspire.

""The Mustang nameplate is known around the world and is a really powerful brand,"" Castriota said in the interview.

Ford had originally focused on a rather bland vehicle just to get it into the market, but in May of 2017, under the charge of new CEO Jim Hackett, Ford began a journey bankrolled by $11.5 billion to come up with ""electrified"" vehicles.

Tesla too has been pouring money into its electric truck efforts. It's already taking preorders for its Model Y crossover that gives drivers 300 miles on a single charge, has 66 cubic feet of cargo space, and comes in all-wheel drive with a dual motor. The Model Y is expected to begin production at the end of next year in the U.S. and in early 2021 in China and Europe. It will be priced starting at $39,000.

Not to let Ford steal any thunder with the Mustang Mach 3, late last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk rolled out its all-electric Cybertruck, which looks like a futuristic machine made of stainless steel and boasts the ability to withstand anything thrown at it, including bullets from a 9mm handgun. It does have something that could help the truck take-off: a price tag starting at $39,900.

Ford's new Mustang Mach-E, which it is accepting preorders for as well, gives drivers 300 miles on one charge and a ton of advanced technology in the vehicle. For instance, the vehicle recognizes the driver as soon as he or she gets near it and dynamically adjusts the seats, mirrors, radio, and instrument panel to that driver. The all-electric crossover will also come equipped with its new intelligent, voice-activated SYNC infotainment system. The base model will come with a single motor, similar to what consumers are used to with a Mustang. The mid-level model will have a second, small motor and all-wheel drive, while the high-end model the Mustang Mach-E GT will have a bigger front motor. According to media reports, the electric vehicles are expected to have a horsepower of around 250 and more than 300 pound-feet of torque.

Ford could sell the Mach-3 at a profit

Ford may not be able to sell as many electric crossovers as Tesla thinks it will sell with the Model Y truck, but more importantly, Ford is likely to sell the car for a profit, which isn't something Tesla is able to do consistently. After all, it's keeping the price range in line with the Model Y, with the Mach-E starting at $45,000 and going up to $65,000.

If Ford is able to pull it off and has a hit with the Mustang Mach-E, it would be huge for the vehicle maker's efforts to crack into the electric vehicle market. That could prompt the car manufacturer to ""electrify"" other older models in the years to come."
270,0.9995,0.118,0.858,0.024,"I'm a gold bear. That means I don't think investors should be storing significant amounts of their savings in the barbarous relic.

You can hear me opine at length on the reasons why in this podcast I did with Tracey Ryniec...

SPDR Gold ETF (GLD - ) is down 6% and my favorite industry is up over 15%, with some key stocks sporting gains of 50-75%.

I'll cover that explosive sector in a moment, right after I tell you what recent event has made me even more bearish on gold.

Astronomers have been studying a large metals-rich asteroid named Psyche in the rocky belt between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars which could contain enough gold to make everyone on the planet a billionaire.

Psyche, discovered by the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on 17 March 1852 from Naples and named after the Greek mythological figure, is one of the ten most massive objects in the asteroid belt. At over 200 km in diameter, it contains a little less than 1% of the mass of the entire asteroid belt.

Most importantly to our discussion here, Psyche is thought to be the exposed iron core of a protoplanet, and is the most massive metallic M-type asteroid. If you know anything about the molten metal core of Earth, you will not be surprised to imagine what Psyche could possess as astronomers have measured and estimated its density to be consistent with that of other metallic asteroids.

According to radar and other sophisticated observations, Psyche appears to have a surface that is 90% metallic and scientists think that these metals are mostly iron and nickel. And this is where the speculation arises that its potential abundance of dense metals could also consist of sizable amounts of gold and platinum.

One estimate is that Psyche, roughly the size of West Virginia, contains over $5,000 quadrillion ($50,000 trillion) of gold at current prices near $1,500.

What if a space-based mining mission were set up on Psyche that could start bringing back tons of new gold?

That amount of new supply would certainly put a dent in gold prices, now wouldn't it?

Well don't worry gold investors because that's a long way off.

Oh wait -- NASA just called and said ""Hold my Krugerrand.""

Mission to Psyche in 2022, Gets There in 2026

From NASA...

""Astronomers on Earth have studied 16 Psyche in visible and infrared wavelengths, as well as radar, which suggest Psyche is shaped somewhat like a potato. Observations indicate that its dimensions are 173 miles by 144 miles, by 117 miles.""

Those measurements are where I took my cue to compare Psyche's size to West Virginia at 24,000 square miles (173 x 144 = 24,900sm).

Psyche takes about five Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun, but only about four hours to rotate on its axis and complete a Psyche “day”. Since scientists wonder whether Psyche could be an exposed core of an early planet that lost its rocky outer layers due to a number of violent collisions billions of years ago, they are extremely curious to begin the first mission to investigate a world of metal rather than of rock and ice.

We cannot see or measure Earth's core directly and so this mission will offer a window into the violent history of collisions and accretion that created terrestrial planets.

More from NASA...

""This intriguing asteroid is now the primary target of the Psyche mission. Targeted to launch in August of 2022, the Psyche spacecraft would arrive at the asteroid in early 2026, following a Mars gravity assist in 2023. Over 21 months in orbit, the spacecraft will map and study 16 Psyche’s properties using a multispectral imager, a gamma ray and neutron spectrometer, a magnetometer, and a radio instrument (for gravity measurement). The mission’s goal is, among other things, to determine whether Psyche is indeed the core of a planet-size object.""

Obviously, NASA's scientific mission has priorities that have nothing to do with finding and mining precious metals. But that doesn't mean commercial space explorers haven't been chomping at the booster rocket to set foot on some metals-rich rocks, after asteroid ownership was made legal for US companies in 2015.

But the only firm with any reasonable shot at participating in that future might be Elon Musk's SpaceX, and not just because the Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) founder is well-funded and ""bold,"" as we learned from the 2016 book by space exploration pioneer Peter Diamandis. In Bold, Diamandis profiled the extra-planetary visions of Musk, Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos of Blue Origin.

But Musk is the first to begin mastering a key technology essential for landing on outer space asteroids with his Falcon Heavy craft that can also return to Earth's atmosphere and land.

Martin Elvis, an astronomer from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, spoke at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in Austin, Texas in 2018 and told the audience that he believes Falcon Heavy has the potential to make asteroid mining a significant commercial reality by increasing the number of asteroids that could be landed on by an order of magnitude.

According to Ryan F. Mandelbaum writing for Gizmodo in 2018, Elvis said of Musk's rocket technology “Instead of a few hundred, we may have thousands of ore-bearing asteroids available.""

We may not see the first ounce of gold from outer space for another 10 years or more. But when we do, it could be cataclysmic for the price of the yellow metal.

The Journey to Alnylam

Now let's talk about the industry that will create more millionaires than gold in the next decade. If you remember the podcast with Tracey in September, or you made an excellent guess, you might know that I'm talking about Biotechnology.

Since that chat, where I discussed some of my special reports like The Century of Biology, one of my favorite investments CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP - Free Report) is up 50%. And my Healthcare Innovators portfolio has an 80% gain as we adjusted our cost basis even more favorably during the October dip under $40.

And even the more diversified, and thus more conservative, ETFs (baskets of stocks) for the industry group are up over 15%, like the Nasdaq Biotech Index (IBB - Free Report) and the equal-weighted S&P Biotech ETF (XBI).

That's because CRSP wasn't the only thing moving in Biotech. We also saw Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT - Free Report) launch over 30% after receiving FDA accelerated approval for their treatment for sickle cell disease.

And then there's Alnylam (ALNY - Free Report) , up 45% since mid October after receiving its second FDA approval to treat a rare genetic disease using RNA interference therapies.

I first identified ALNY as a promising Biotech investment in 2013 when it was trading under $30. It has quadrupled since then to nearly $120 and so I'm very glad I put my Healthcare Innovators members back in the stock at $80 last month.

ALNY is named after Alnilam, a large blue supergiant star some 2,000 light-years distant in the constellation of Orion. It is estimated to be 275,000 to 832,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and 30–64.5 times as massive.

We won't be traveling there any time soon. But in the time it takes the NASA mission to land on Psyche, ALNY shares could quadruple again.

You won't get that from gold in the next 7 years.

This is an exquisite coincidence for me as a gold bear who thinks it should be worth less than $500 an ounce -- while I also believe that Alnylam could at least triple in a longer journey to 2026 by virtue of its leading platform R&D in RNAi.

The Genomic Revolution

Whenever I talk about ""the century of biology"" or the prospects for genetic and cell therapies, I tell people they should be excited to be living right in the middle of this revolution.

Even if you don't have capital available to invest or time to research the companies, the research and discoveries being made are world-changing. There will be ethical challenges with gene editing and the costs associated with advanced therapies.

But there will also always be wonder to behold on the bleeding edges of science.

And so one plea I also make to new Biotech investors is the one I made recently on an episode of The Paper Traders podcast...

Navigating The Healthcare Industry: Science Fiction Turns to Reality

In that chat I made the case very strongly that every investor should at least buy a Biotech ETF like IBB, XBI, or the ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG - Free Report) . This accomplishes at least two things: first, you are invested in the industry with very low risk, and second, you expose yourself to learning about the top ten companies within the ETFs.

Or I should say, I at least hope you become curious about them.

Because becoming more curious about science and technology is never a bad thing.

And it may actually become a necessary thing in the next few decades. I know this is a wild idea to most because the presidential candidate who intrigues me most, is among those least likely to win as too few citizens care about his ideas or vision: Andrew Yang.

Yang really understands the power of technology like AI, automation and even Biotech that are about to drastically change the world. He also knows that education is the most important institution we need to be reinventing to help people respond creatively to these unstoppable revolutions.

To understand why I think he has greater vision than any other candidate, see these 2 podcasts/articles...

271,0.9976,0.134,0.862,0.004,"Lots of investors were puzzled after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its Cybertruck on Thursday night. It's apparently not designed to compete directly with the huge-selling, and hugely profitable, full-size pickups from the Detroit Three, but for whom was it designed?

What's the point of a truck that looks like it was taken from the set of a low-budget 1970s dystopian science-fiction film? Sure, Tesla's claims for its performance are impressive, but Tesla is good at performance, and at making impressive claims. And at least some Tesla fans are enamored of the slab-sided stainless beast.

But what is Tesla really hoping to accomplish here? I think CEO Elon Musk has given us a few big hints since the truck's Thursday-night reveal.

Is this all about the preorders?

I noted with interest on Friday that Tesla requires a deposit of just $100 to secure a ""preorder"" of the Cybertruck. That's a lot less than the $2,500 deposit required to order the company's upcoming Model Y crossover ($2,500) and the $1,000 it required to secure a reservation when the Model 3 sedan was first launched.

Some analysts have speculated that deposits on upcoming models have been important sources of cash flow at certain points in Tesla's history. But the $20 million that Tesla presumably raised through Monday is a trivial sum, a fraction of what Tesla will spend on the development work needed to turn the Cybertruck into a real product.

A thousand dollars or more is enough to give plenty of people pause before ordering, especially the young people who make up a disproportionate share of Tesla's fan base. But $100? Lots of people can come up with $100, especially when it's refundable. In fact, those who most ardently support Tesla's ""mission"" could probably come up with more than $100 -- enough to ""preorder"" several Cybertrucks.

What if that's the point? What if Tesla's real goal here, at least in the near term, is to generate a big preorder total -- one that could, for instance, be used to help support a stock offering to raise more cash?

Why Tesla might be looking to raise more cash

I'm hardly the first person to observe that Musk and Tesla often seem to make decisions that are driven by the company's stock price, its cash balance, or both. That's hardly ideal for long-term-minded investors, but so far it hasn't mattered much.

Tesla had $5.3 billion in cash and equivalents as of the end of the third quarter. That seems like a reasonable reserve, but it's probably not enough to fund everything that Tesla has promised to deliver (Model Y, Semi, Roadster 2, factory in China, possible factory in Europe, Cybertruck...) over the next couple of years.

Now, 200,000 preorders isn't a lot for a full-size pickup truck. For context, it's about three months' worth of Ford F-Series sales. But at an average selling price of $50,000, it's about $10 billion in future revenue, if -- and it's a big if -- those preorders convert to actual sales.

That might be enough to convince an investment bank or two that Tesla is finally becoming a sustainable business. If that's the goal, we'll probably know soon."
272,0.969,0.094,0.86,0.047,"TSLA (TSLA - Free Report) fell over 6% following Elon’s awkward debut of the Tesla Cyber Truck, which ended in a few broken windows and ostensibly broken promises. Telsa’s new truck is taking an enormous style risk appearing to have come straight out of an 80s Syfy movie.

Critics had a field day after this event relating the design of this vehicle to one that a child drew on MacPaint (AAPL - Free Report) in the 90s. This gave TSLA short-sellers a new reason to get excited about betting against this highly volatile stock.

Despite the Tesla haters, I think that this design risk may pay off. The Cyber Truck has already racked up roughly 200,000 orders as of the beginning of this week. It seems that Elon Musk can do no wrong with his loyal cohorts.

The specs of this new vehicle are something to marvel at, and the most impressive part about this vehicle is its battery technology. Not only can this truck overpower an F150 (F - Free Report) , but it will boast the longest-range EV on the market.

The Cyber Truck will be able to accelerate from 0-60 in 2.9 seconds and contains a battery with a range of up to 500 miles. This will outpace its own Tesla S, which can run as many as 335 miles on one charge (the longest range EV on the market).

Tesla continues to stay ahead of the innovation curve, and the Cyber Truck release proves its willingness to take pioneering risks. Tesla stock has rallied 85% since the beginning of June as more positive news and sentiment come out of this fast-moving company.

TSLA is still roughly 15% off its all-time highs, and with its momentum in the second half of the year, I think we can blow past those highs.

273,0.9878,0.09,0.866,0.044,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) shares edged higher Monday after a botched Friday debut of its new pickup truck that Elon Musk has dubbed Cybertruck. The unveiling went off course when Musk asked his head of design to throw a small metal ball at the vehicle’s side window.

The metal ball ended up cracking the window much to the surprise of the audience and Musk. After the debacle at the premier, TSLA shares slipped Friday as Wall Street was hardly impressed with the design. Despite the eccentric showcase, Musk announced Monday on Twitter (TWTR - Free Report) that orders for the new truck were doing better than most expected.

Footage of the window of the electric pickup truck shattering made its rounds on social media as the public all shared their opinions on the uniquely shaped automobile.

F - Free Report) and General Motors (GM - Free Report) . Tesla’s Cybertruck pickup is polarizing, with its angular design that makes it stand out and hard to describe. The price of the new vehicle is set to start at $39,900, which is about $10,000 less than expected.

However, while the entry-level rear-wheel drive Cybertruck is set to cost less than $40,000, the higher-end, more-capable all-wheel-drive versions will be priced up to $69,900. The priciest version of the electric pickup boasts a zero-to-sixty acceleration time in 2.9 seconds, up to 500 miles of range, and can tow 14,000 pounds.

Tesla didn’t seem to skimp on the performance capabilities that most pickup consumers look for, but some worry that the odd design might not have mass appeal. During the production of the pickup, some inside the company worried that Musk would let his personal preferences overly influence the design. Despite the design backlash, Tesla has already received 200,000 orders for the new Cybertruck according to Musk.

Can the Cybertruck Transcend the Nascent Market?

Putting aside the failure and unconventional design, can Tesla’s new pickup truck appeal to a broad audience? Tesla first defied conventional automotive industry wisdom by betting that consumers would be willing to pay a premium to drive an electric car.

A sleek design was a central part of the formula, as Tesla aimed to inspire consumers to buy an unconventionally modern looking car. It seems Tesla adopted the same strategy with its unique Cybertruck design that it hopes can attract the pickup truck consumer.

The automotive company has time for its Cybertruck to grow on consumers despite the initial backlash as most don't expect a release until the latter half of 2021 and the electric pickup truck market is just entering its infancy. Research firm IHS Markit (INFO - Free Report) projects electric vehicles will account for about 9% of the US automobile market in 2026, up from less than 2% today. Joseph Spak, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, called the Tesla pickup “a Hummer for the green millennial generation; really the ultimate virtue and vice signaling machine.”

Bottom Line

Apart from the unorthodox design and embarrassing accident at the showcase, the capabilities of the truck seem to be in line with what pickup truck enthusiasts would look for. Additionally, the strong preorder numbers reported by Musk may indicate that consumers have looked past Wall Street’s initial worries.

However, investors should note that Ford and GM have already announced plans to design their own electric pickups, with GM set to release its vehicle in the fall of 2021. This may not bode well for Tesla as pickup consumers are known to be brand loyal, and Ford and GM have long dominated the pickup truck landscape.

On top of all that, TSLA remains a volatile stock that has been on a roller coaster ride year-to-date. However, the automaker’s recent performance has helped make up for some of the losses it endured earlier as it is has gained over 55% in the past 12 weeks. Our Q4 estimates forecast a 35.75% bottom-line decline to $1.24 per share and for sales to slip 1.82% to $7.09 billion.

274,0.9094,0.07,0.88,0.05,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA) and Consumer Reports are friends again. The love-hate relationship took a turn for the better after two of Tesla's electric vehicles landed on the group's recommendation list.

It marks an about-face for the consumer watchdog group, which has snubbed Tesla in the past, much to the disdain of CEO Elon Musk, who has used his Twitter feed to slam the group. Consumer Reports lost faith in the Model 3 in February due to what it said was too many reliability issues to ignore.

In its most recent annual survey, Consumer Reports said it is now recommending the Model 3 and Model S sedans because of improving reliability. ""The Tesla Model 3 struggled last year as the company made frequent design changes and ramped up production to meet demand,"" Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at CR, said in a press release announcing the results of its annual survey. ""But as the production stabilized, we have seen improvements to the reliability.""

Tesla manufacturing finally humming along

Those comments are music to Tesla's ears. After months of manufacturing missteps and snafus with the Model 3, Tesla's production appears to be humming along here and overseas. That may bode well for the stock if an endorsement from Consumer Reports lifts sales of its vehicles. Safety and reliability are big selling points for consumers, particularly for ones behind the wheel of an all-electric vehicle.

It completed its Shanghai Giga Factory ahead of schedule and just announced the first vehicles for the Chinese market have rolled off the production line. It also revealed Berlin will be the location of its European manufacturing plant and said the Model Y is ahead of schedule. It was also able to post third-quarter gross margins that were up despite a decline in average selling prices. Gross margins came in at 22.8%, up from 18.9% in the second quarter.

In order for Tesla to continue to thrive, its manufacturing and production needs to be predictable. It also needs the faith of consumers that its vehicles are safe as well as efficient. The support of Consumer Reports can go a long way here.

In announcing its annual list, Consumer Reports said customers reported fewer problems than in past years with the body of the Model 3 and Model S. Some of the issues that got it in trouble with Consumer Reports include trunks that don't close properly and latches that get stuck with the older models. There were also fewer reports about paint and trim quality issues than in the past. Cruise control, cameras and other power equipment also received fewer complaints.

Consumer Reports won't recommend the Model X

Consumer Reports said it's still not recommending Tesla's Model X SUV and said the in-car electronics ""[continue] to be a weakness"" with reports of problems with the displays. Consumer Reports' Fisher attributed the reliability issues to Tesla's manufacturing approach. It makes changes to its vehicles throughout the year as they are being manufactured, which creates instability. Tesla's vehicles do consistently well at on-road tests, but the annual surveys have shown inconsistent reliability from one year to the next, Consumer Reports said.

Consumer Reports may be a fan of the Model 3 and Model S, but it's not showing love to Tesla's Smart Summon feature, which lets car owners summon their vehicles from a parking spot or driveway without a driver behind the wheel. Consumer Reports called the automation ""glitchy"" and said there weren't many ""obvious benefits"" for consumers. ""What consumers are really getting is the chance to participate in a kind of science experiment,"" Fisher said in October. ""This is a work in progress.""

Despite the love-hate relationship between the two entities, investors welcomed the news, sending the stock up slightly the day it was announced. Shares of Tesla have been on an upswing since the company reported a surprise profit in its third quarter. With an upbeat outlook, production humming along and Consumer Reports in its pocket, Tesla is riding high, at least for now."
275,0.993,0.124,0.839,0.037,"Tesla, Inc. ’s (TSLA - Free Report) relationship with Panasonic Corp. (PCRFY - Free Report) has hit a rough patch, after the latter recently denied any plan to set up a new battery cell factory for Tesla in China. It also suggested that Tesla could either access battery cells from Gigafactory 1 in the United States, where Panasonic is the exclusive supplier, or can simply use cells produced in China by other manufacturers.

Reportedly, the joint venture between Panasonic and Tesla for Gigafactory 1 in the United States has not generated sustainable profits yet due to lower sales of Tesla Model S and Model X. Earlier this year, the two companies also shelved plans to widen Gigafactory 1 beyond its current capacity of 35 GWh.

Tesla’s supply-chain problems have been restricting its ability to hold back production of Model 3 sedan in China, as the company depends on Panasonic, its single-source supplier, for many components. The inability of Panasonic to increase volume in order to meet Tesla’s rising demand limits the automaker’s ability to expand production capacity.

Per Bloomberg, Tesla has signed an agreement with South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. to source batteries for its Gigafactory 3 in China. LG Chem will provide Tesla with 21700 type battery cells, which will be used in Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y cars.

Tesla has also entered into a preliminary agreement of battery supply with China’s biggest battery producer, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL). Per this agreement, the company will procure cells for Tesla’s Model 3 cars which will be manufactured in Gigafactory 3 in China.

China is the largest electric vehicle market in the world by a substantial amount, almost doubling that of the Unites States. Tesla's latest China plant will give the company direct access to this market and allow Tesla to cut costs substantially. In a letter to shareholders, Elon Musk said that this factory was 65% cheaper than any Model 3 factory built in the United States.

The Gigafactory 3 is currently in trial production and plans to make the plant fully operational by the end of this year. In Phase 1, Tesla expects to produce 250,000 cars for China annually and reach its capacity of 500,000 units in the years after.

276,0.0772,0.059,0.896,0.045,"When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its futuristic Cybertruck on Thursday, critics mocked its appearance. ""Tesla's Cybertruck is a jarringly angular stainless-steel-bodied behemoth that looks like it escaped from the set of a dystopian sci-fi film,"" Motley Fool auto expert John Rosevear wrote at the time.

Many analysts predicted that rather than making it a legitimate challenger to Ford 's (NYSE:F) best-selling F-150 pickup trucks, Cybertruck's nontraditional design would relegate it to becoming one of the auto industry's niche products. But judging by the surging number of early preorders for the radical electronic vehicle, these analysts might be underestimating demand for Tesla's latest creation.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday that Cybertruck preorders had reached 200,000. Musk said that figure is up from 187,000 earlier on Sunday and 146,000 on Saturday, suggesting that the number of preorders is rising rapidly.

Prospective customers must pay Tesla $100 to be among the first to obtain a Cybertruck. These preorders have therefore already raised $20 million for Tesla. It should be noted, however, that the preorder deposits are fully refundable and do not equate to sales of the vehicle.

Still, the surprisingly high number of Cybertruck preorders suggests that Tesla's marketing strategy is working -- and that the polarizing electronic-vehicle maker could sell far more of its gnarly new trucks than its detractors would have you believe."
277,0.9853,0.101,0.871,0.027,"After its unveiling on Thursday night, Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck saw a mixed reception (at best) in the news and across social media. The market was certainly disappointed, as Tesla shares dipped 6% on the day following the truck's unveiling.

But is the polarizing truck growing on people? Less than 48 hours after the big reveal, Tesla had racked up 146,000 reservations for the vehicle. By Sunday, reservations hit 200,000. Further, the stock's decline has notably come to a halt. Shares are up 1.3% as of this writing on Monday -- well above the S&P 500's 0.6% rise.

Could Cybertruck be a hit after all?

Some context

While it's impressive that Tesla has already hit 200,000 Cybertruck reservations, investors should note that the company is only requiring a $100 refundable deposit to commit to a reservation. This compares to the $1,000 deposit Tesla required for customers to get in line for its Model 3 in 2016.

Still, garnering 200,000 reservations within a few days of the truck's unveiling is a notable achievement. By comparison, Tesla said it had accumulated 373,000 reservations for Model 3 within a month and a half of its unveiling.

Even if a meaningful portion of these customers canceled their orders, this would still represent a significant revenue opportunity for the electric-car maker. When CEO Elon Musk said on Saturday afternoon that Cybertruck reservations had reached 146,000, he noted that 42% of preorders were for its dual motor version, which starts at $49,900; 41% were for its $69,900 tri motor version; and 17% were for the $39,900 single motor version. Extrapolating those percentages to 200,000 reservations, these preorders could convert into $8 billion -- and that's if none of these customers pay for upgrades beyond the battery capacity and motor configurations they select.

The customer interest is particularly interesting in light of the vehicle's timeline. Tesla doesn't even plan to start producing the vehicle until late 2021, with production of the tri motor version not expected to begin until late 2022.

An impressive marketing feat

Even this initial wave of customer interest might not adequately define the market opportunity for Tesla. If many of these interested customers are not typical truck owners, it could be difficult to sustain high levels of demand beyond first-year availability. Further, there are always risks to Tesla's execution when it comes to bringing this vehicle to market; its stark difference in design compared to current Tesla models could make ramping up production more difficult than anticipated.

Still, one thing is certain: The truck's unveiling has proved a brilliant marketing achievement. As Musk said on Twitter over the weekend, these reservations occurred without any paid advertising or endorsements. The vehicle has undoubtedly brought more attention to the company's brand."
278,0.9976,0.08,0.909,0.01,"While electric cars have been on the road for nearly a decade now, automakers are yet to bring any electric truck to the market. Consumers are spoilt for choice, with a rising number of electric SUV and crossover launches. Meanwhile, although pickups have been the undisputed best-seller, there isn't a single plug-in hybrid truck, let alone a fully-electric one. So, while electric cars are taking off in a big way, why has the idea of electric pickup been slow to catch on?

Why is it Taking Time for Trucks to Shift Gears Into Electric?

Although electric vehicles can do a lot for a greener environment, this can only happen if these become as popular as their fuel-powered predecessors. For starters, pickup owners are one of the most brand-loyal customers in the auto industry and it would be quite difficult to persuade them to make the switch from an internal combustion engine to electrification.

Further, launching an electric pickup comes with its own set of challenges.Unlike cars, pickup trucks are more equipped to deal with rough terrain and heavy load. Under such circumstances, a major issue is how far the vehicle can run before its battery runs out. Enhancing battery capabilities so that large loads can be carried for long distances is a pressing issue, as heavy batteries can take a toll on efficiency. The major challenge here is to achieve substantial volumes and profits to make it a sustainable business.

Also, buyers of trucks are not willing to shell out more money for the electric versions, thus creating a problem for the manufacturers who are under pressure to sell more EVs amid stringent emission standards. While the switch to the electric versions of these high-emitting vehicles could go a long way in abating carbon emissions, diesel advocates believe that range and recharging are major challenges in the way of electric pickups.

Electric Pickup Game is Gradually Building

With reducing battery prices, increasing costs for carbon-burning engines and stricter emissions compliance standards, automakers have started reconsidering their business models. In fact, for exponential growth of EVs, it is important to tap the uncontested markets for electric pickups.

As we know, Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) is making headlines for its new Cybertruck, which was recently unveiled by Elon Musk. Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

While the long-awaited Tesla electric truck is getting a lot of attention, it isn’t just this company that will hog the spotlight in the electric pickup market. Competition is building up, with Ford (F - Free Report) prepping its all-electric F-150, General Motors (GM - Free Report) entering the market in 2021, and Ford and Amazon (AMZN - Free Report) -backed EV startup Rivian bringing something interesting as early as next year. Here we will focus on the major electric trucks that are set to be launched in the coming years, both by startups and well-established auto giants like Ford and General Motors.

Sneak Peek Into Electric Pickup of Contenders

With a wedge-like shape, ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless-steel body and armored glass windows, the design of Tesla’s Cybertruck seems quite stylish and futuristic. There will be three models, the cheapest of which — at $39,900 — has a 7,500-pound towing capacity, a range of 250 miles and a startup speed of 0-60 mph of less than 6.5 seconds. However, during the launch of the vehicle, things didn’t end well as the windows pretty much cracked in a thousand directions when struck with a metal ball, which “didn’t go through” though. Nonetheless, more than 200,000 pre orders for the same have poured in for the Cybertruck.

U.S. auto giant, General Motors reportedly invested $3 billion in the electric truck program and targets to put up a pickup truck for sale by the fall of 2021. Rumors about the firm’s truck plans surfaced last month when Detroit Free Press reported that Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant would remain open for the production of electric pickup truck, as part of the firm’s UAW labor contract negotiations. While General Motors did not mention a timeline for the release then, the firm’s CEO recently confirmed to bring the electric truck to market in 2021.

U.S. #2 automaker Ford, which had built the nation’s best-selling pickup truck F-150, is set to launch an all-electric version of the same. While the company has confirmed plans to develop a fully-electric F-150 at the 2019 Detroit Show, the vehicle is reportedly set to debut in 2021. There is no official announcement regarding the launch of the electric Ford truck as yet, but the rumor mill is buzzing about the vehicle being fast-tracked for production. The biggest hint about the electric Ford-150’s future came in July, when the firm released a video demonstrating the pickup’s remarkable towing capacity. The electric F-150 prototype was seen pulling ten double-decker rail cars filled with 42 F-150 pickups, weighing nearly one million pound. Although the company has not shared any specific specs regarding the electric truck yet, we expect it to be a hit. Apart from making its own pickup, Ford announced an investment of $500 million in electric pickup startup Rivian.

Startups Speeding Up

Startups like Rivian, Bollinger and Lordstown are entering the market alongside stalwarts like Tesla, Ford and General Motors.

American startup Rivian is set to come up with its electric truck by late 2020. The R1T will offer several motor/battery combinations to choose from. The truck has the ability to tow up to 11,000 pounds, an adjustable air suspension and Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities. The company is targeting a starting price of $69,000 for the base version of R1T. However, the superior versions are expected to be put up for sale first, which would range around $1,00,000.

Bollinger Motors’ Bollinger B2, priced at $125,000, is likely to be the most expensive of the upcoming electric trucks. Geared with axle hubs and hydropneumatics suspension, Bollinger B2 claims a respectable 614 horsepower and 668 lb-ft of torque from its dual-motor setup. While production is slated to start in the second half of 2020, one has to wait till early 2021 to get a hand on the vehicle.

Lordstown Motors has also been making headlines after it purchased the shuttered Lordstown plant from General Motors. The company has started accepting $1000 deposits to reserve its electric pickup truck, the 2021 Lordstown Endurance. Production of the Endurance is anticipated to commence in late 2020, with deliveries starting around the same time.

Last Words

To find out who is going to create the best electric truck and rev up in this race, we will have to wait till 2021. It remains to seen whether trucks can become tickets to high sales in the electric vehicle market.

Shares sank 6% on the trading day following the event as analysts expressed concerns that the vehicle wouldn't appeal to a mass audience.

Tesla's Cybertruck is priced to sell, particularly given its strong specs. But its style is polarizing. The truck features an out-of-this-world angular design that is unlike anything seen before.

Here's a closer look.

Pricing and availability

The truck will start at a price of $39,900 -- about $10,000 lower than expected. But versions with more powerful batteries and improved performance will be available for $49,900 and $69,900. The company's driver-assist technology, Autopilot, will come standard on the vehicle.

The electric-car company expects production of the single motor rear-wheel drive version of the truck to start in late 2021. Production of its dual-motor and tri-motor all-wheel-drive versions will begin in late 2022, Tesla predicts.

Performance

As has become expected of Tesla, the vehicle's performance specifications are impressive. With a zero-to-sixty acceleration time as fast as 2.9 seconds, up to 500 miles of range, and towing capacity of more than 14,000 pounds for the priciest version of the truck, Tesla didn't skimp on performance.

Exterior, interior, and storage

As far as the Cybertruck's exterior, Tesla boasted about its durability. ""Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every component is designed for superior strength and endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass,"" the company says on its website.

While the vehicle's steel lived up to the hype during a demonstration at the unveiling event, the Tesla armor glass apparently still needs some work. The driver's side window shattered when Tesla tried to demonstrate its durability by throwing a steel ball at it. Hoping this wouldn't be the case with the rear window, a Tesla executive tried throwing the ball at the rear passenger window and the same thing happened. ""Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,"" Musk said in a tweet about the glass following the event.

Thanks to a front trunk and a 6.5-foot truck bed with diagonal retractable encasing, the Cybertruck impressively boasts 100 cubic feet of exterior, plus lockable storage.

The truck's interior doesn't disappoint, either, seating six adults comfortably, according to Tesla.

Of course, the vehicle features Tesla's signature barbaric, minimalistic design and a 17-inch touch display where drivers and passengers interact with the vehicle.

For the most part, Tesla exceeded expectations when it comes to utility, performance, and specs. But the design is raising eyebrows."
280,0.9352,0.062,0.916,0.022,"Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) CEO Elon Musk has finally unveiled his pet project after talking about it intermittently for years.

Cybertruck as it’s called is kind of conical or triangular in shape, with an ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel body and armored glass windows with 100 cubic feet of storage space. The 6.5 foot vault will have a 4-inch suspension on each side. The touchscreen sitting in the middle of the dashboard measures 17-inches.

The flashy demo included strikes with a sledge hammer and bullets that the beast could withstand. However, it didn’t end well as the windows pretty much cracked in a thousand directions when struck with a metal ball, which “didn’t go through” though.

There will be three models, the cheapest of which, at $39,900 has a 7,500-pound towing capacity, a range of 250 miles and a startup speed of 0-60 mph of less than 6.5 seconds. This is a single-motor vehicle.

The range, capacity and start speeds are bumped up to 10,000 pounds, 300 miles and 4.5 seconds in the mid-range model, which is priced at $49,900. This is a dual-motor vehicle.

The top-of-the-rung vehicle with triple-motor all-wheel drive can do 14,000 pounds, 500 miles between charges and start up in 2.9 seconds. This one costs $69,900 and will only start production in 2022.

The pricing structure is interesting given that most truck-buyers don’t mind spending something around $50,000 (JD Power VP, as quoted by The Verge). So the mid-range model is poised to challenge the Fords (F - Free Report) , General Motors (GM - Free Report) and Fiat Chryslers (FCA - Free Report) out there. But in case anyone wants to play safe (since there’s nothing to compare this with exactly), or thinks the design is wanting, they can try out the cheaper version. The last category is for the really big users, mainly for work.

In Musk’s own words, ""We need sustainable energy now. If we don't have a pickup truck, we can't solve it. The top 3 selling vehicles in America are pickup trucks. To solve sustainable energy, we have to have a pickup truck."" That’s why this project has really been close to his heart.

We don’t have a launch date yet and anyway, Tesla has been better at missing rather than meeting deadlines thus far. Of course, with the China factory coming online, sales to China should be more manageable now. But Tesla also has the Model Y coming up, so it’s really hard to tell.

Competition is building up in the meantime with Ford prepping its all-electric F-150, General Motors entering the market in 2021, and Ford and Amazon (AMZN - Free Report) -backed EV startup Rivian bringing something as early as next year.

Tesla shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All

Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early."
281,0.9814,0.093,0.852,0.055,"At this point in the solar industry's development, it seems like residential solar installers should be generating leads online and through social media and closing deals without ever meeting the customer face to face. After all, these are technology companies, so using technology to make the sales and marketing process more efficient makes all the sense in the world.

In reality, most residential solar installations are sold with high-touch sales methods like door-to-door and telemarketing contacts that seem to be out of the 1980s. Even if a customer is reached through a digital channel, a personal visit is often needed to close the deal. The problem for installers is that these sales methods are getting more and more costly, and as a result, residential solar installations are actually getting less cost-effective. If the trend continues, it'll be tough for some of the most well-known renewable energy stocks to beat the market or compete with traditional sources of energy.

The solar sales conundrum

Long-term, we would expect that all costs going into a solar installation would come down over time. Solar panels are getting cheaper, installation is getting more efficient, and sales, marketing, and general costs should be spread over a wider base as these companies grow. But that's not at all what we're seeing.

Below is a table showing the installation, sales and marketing, and general and administration costs that go into each watt of solar installed at Vivint Solar (NYSE:VSLR). You can see that installation costs are slowly coming down and so are overhead costs, but sales and marketing expenses have exploded.

General and administrative $0.38 $0.36 $0.33
Sales and marketing $0.77 $1.03 $1.37
Installation $1.82 $1.77 $1.78
Total $2.97 $3.16 $3.48

Data source: Vivint Solar earnings releases.

Below are the same figures for the largest residential solar installer in the country, Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN). The trends are similar.

Component Q3 2017 Q3 2018 Q3 2019
General and administrative $0.27 $0.23 $0.25
Sales and marketing $0.49 $0.73 $0.81
Installation $2.72 $2.52 $2.48
Total $3.34 $3.34 $3.28

Data source: Sunrun earnings releases.

A small portion of the increased cost can be attributed to the cost of expanding into new markets since there's a lag between spending on sales and marketing and when that turns into significant installations. But management pointed out in its quarterly filing that the increase in sales and marketing cost is due to higher compensation expenses and higher costs to acquire customers through retail channels. The continual cost increase of these ongoing expenses is the real problem.

No efficient options for solar sales

Solar companies simply haven't found an efficient way to reach customers and explain their value proposition. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) tried online sales only to see its solar business shrink into oblivion. SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) is trying to use automated tools online to assist dealers in quoting and closing sales, but there's still a very manual sales process involved for its dealers. The problem now is that costs aren't stable as you might expect if sales methods were as effective as they were a few years ago, they're rising rapidly.

One big reason costs are increasing is that the low-hanging fruit (customers highly interested in rooftop solar) has already been picked. Early adopters who may have been a pull on demand have already installed solar and companies are now having to push product more into the market. This makes the sales process more difficult and costly over time. Vivint and Sunrun have tried to lower costs by working with partner channels and offering more tools for customers to learn about solar online, but none have led to a decrease in acquisition costs per watt sold.

Growing for growth's sake

Residential solar companies have been able to mask some of these rising costs by leveraging low interest rates to get cheap financing and even by raising prices. But long-term, the sales and marketing component of solar energy needs to start coming down to be sustainable. Vivint Solar and Sunrun don't seem to have the answer to that problem and that may open the door to smaller, more nimble competitors to eventually take market share.

I think the answer is that these companies need to slow their growth and become more efficient, not grow as quickly as they can. Growth may actually be a path to disaster, as it was for SolarCity before its fortunate bailout by Tesla. Hopefully, for investors, that doesn't happen again."
282,0.9329,0.088,0.892,0.02,"What happened

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were trading sharply lower on Friday morning after the Thursday-night reveal of the company's Cybertruck pickup fell short of expectations.

As of 11:00 a.m. EST, Tesla's shares were down about 6% from Thursday's closing price.

So what

Investors had expected Tesla's much-touted pickup truck to be a more-or-less forthright electric challenger to the huge-selling (and hugely profitable) full-size pickups from Ford Motor (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU).

But CEO Elon Musk had other plans.

As you can see, Tesla's Cybertruck is a jarringly angular stainless-steel-bodied behemoth that looks like it escaped from the set of a dystopian sci-fi film. While the claims for range and towing capacity and so forth are impressive -- as one would expect from Tesla -- the design of the Cybertruck and its decidedly oddball features suggest strongly that it will be a niche product at best -- and that much development work remains to be done.

At least in its current form, it's not a truck for truck buyers. That means it's unlikely to sell in anything like Detroit-pickup volumes, and investors appear to be adjusting their expectations accordingly.

Now what

Customers can reserve a Cybertruck with a deposit of just $100, a hint that Tesla might be hoping to rack up strong reservation numbers. Good early numbers might impress investors, but take note: Tesla's site warns that the first deliveries won't happen until late 2021 at the earliest, and GM and Ford are both expected to have battery-electric pickups on sale by then.

It's far too early to even guess how the competition will shape up, but -- at least right now -- auto investors seem to think that Tesla missed an opportunity."
283,0.9927,0.103,0.874,0.023,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Tesla (TSLA - Free Report) . Shares have added about 18.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Tesla due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

Tesla Q3 EarningsTop, Down Y/Y
Tesla reported earnings per share of $1.86 in third-quarter 2019, against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 15 cents. This outperformance resulted from continued volume growth and cost control, which is an important combination for achieving sustained, industry-leading profitability. The company had recorded earnings of $2.90 per share in the prior-year quarter.

During the reported quarter, net income attributable to common shareholders amounted to $143 million compared with the year-ago net income of $311 million.

Revenues declined to $6.3 billion from the $6.82 billion registered in third-quarter 2018. The revenue figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.52 billion.

During the quarter under review, Tesla reported record delivery of 97,000 vehicles and production of 96,000 units.

Total automotive revenues, including that from automotive sales and leasing, decreased 12% year over year to $5.35 billion in the quarter.

Energy generation and storage revenues increased from $399 million in third-quarter 2018 to $402 million in the reported quarter. Services and other revenues were up significantly year over year to $548 million.

Tesla’s third-quarter 2019 automotive gross margin was 22.8%, shrinking 297 basis points (bps) from third-quarter 2018.

Financial Position

Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $5.34 billion as of Sep 30, 2019, compared with $2.97 billion, as of Sep 30, 2018.

Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $756 million in third-quarter 2019 compared with $1.39 billion of net cash used in third-quarter 2018. Capital expenditure declined to $385 million from the year-ago quarter’s $510 million.

Model 3 Update

In third-quarter 2019, Tesla reported record Model 3 delivery of 79,703. During the quarter, the production rate of Model 3 continued to improve. Reducing waiting times and improving service experience are the company’s top priorities. It opened 11 new service centers in the quarter and added 68 Mobile Service vehicles to their fleet.

Outlook

Tesla is making efforts to raise vehicle deliveries, sequentially and annually, with some expected fluctuations from seasonality. The company is highly confident in exceeding 360,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019. Importantly, it expects positive quarterly free cash flow as well as net income, in the upcoming period, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp-up of new products.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision. The consensus estimate has shifted 102.45% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

At this time, Tesla has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months."
284,0.9984,0.146,0.811,0.043,"Predicting the future for any company is never an exact science, but when it comes to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) it's almost an exercise in futility. After all, the carmaker is known for overpromising and underperforming. It's also operating in a market that's seeing increased competition, threatening its leadership position.

Nonetheless, Tesla could remain the leader in what may be a bigger market in five years, granted it's able to execute. In order to do that, it needs robust demand, international expansion, and diversification into other markets. It also needs CEO Elon Musk to perform. A tall order, but one that, judging from its recent moves, is possible.

Tesla has the leadership role for now

Tesla is by far the leader in the electric vehicle market today. The company and its celebrity CEO Musk are household names. It has a huge following of supporters and an equal amount of critics. Investing in Tesla requires resolve given the volatile nature of its performance and its stock price. Earlier in 2019, it was dealing with losses, and come spring, it has a surprise profit.

While the electric vehicle market is tiny today, it's expected to explode in the coming years. According to Allied Market Research, the electric vehicle market was valued at around $118 billion in 2017 and is forecast to grow to $567 billion by 2025, representing a CAGR of 22.3% from 2018 to 2025.

Tesla has the potential to maintain its leadership position in that growing market as environmentally conscious consumers and those seeking more technology in their vehicles are drawn to the company. The latter is expected to drive much of the demand for Tesla in the near term. New features like Smart Summon are generating a lot of buzz. The feature enables customers to summon their car from a parking spot or driveway without a driver behind the wheel. Since its launch in September, it's been used more than one million times.

Tesla was here first

Tesla has the first-mover advantage as well, but that doesn't mean its leadership won't be tested. A lot of vehicle manufacturers, including Ford (NYSE:F) and BMW, are getting into the market. Assuming Tesla can keep growing sales, the car company will be in a good position to succeed as a stock.

Also boosting Tesla's prospects is its international expansion. Selling its cars in as many countries as possible is critical to the company's future success. It already has manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Shanghai. Musk announced this week that the fourth Gigafactory will be located in Berlin. By positioning manufacturing in these regions, Tesla can more easily serve international customers.

China is an important market for the carmaker given the large pool of consumers it can tap. The company plans to build 3,000 Model 3 cars per week at the factory that just rolled the first models off the line. If these cars are popular in China, it could help Tesla maintain a global leadership position in the electric vehicle market.

But Tesla has to execute on the manufacturing front to make this all possible. Any snafus, like the ones that plagued the Model 3, could be its death knell. The last thing Tesla needs is to burn through cash trying to fix production problems. It ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion in cash.

Tesla is also continuing to innovate with its vehicles, including an electric truck that it plans to unveil on November 21. Musk has been teasing the truck for months now but is keeping the look under wraps for maximum impact. He described it as something out of Blade Runner. Pricing is expected to be around $49,000, undercutting its rival Rivian, which is rolling out two electric trucks starting at $61,000.

Energy could be the next bastion of growth

Beyond electric vehicles, Tesla has an opportunity to diversify the business into the energy market, which could boost shares if it becomes something meaningful. With climate change reaching crisis levels and now a top concern for millions of people, demand for alternative energy sources is only expected to grow. If Tesla can deliver products that meet that need, it could be a huge opportunity. Musk said as much when reporting third-quarter earnings. He predicted Tesla's energy business will be big or bigger than its car operations.

How successful Tesla will ultimately be is up in the air. Its solar roof tiles, which it just launched a new iteration of, haven't taken off with consumers yet, but there are promising signs that the business is finding its footing. It reported that energy storage deployment hit 477 MWh in the third quarter, an all-time high for the company. During the quarter, it deployed 43 MW of solar, which is 48% more than in the second quarter. Keep in mind that two years ago it deployed more than 160 MW of solar.

Investors in Tesla have had a rocky ride over the years, but it seems to be firing on all cylinders these days. It got its production up and running in China, its gross margins increased even as the price of the Model 3 comes down, and it's about to launch a new truck.

If Tesla can stay the course, it's poised for more growth over the next five years."
285,0.9811,0.06,0.94,0.0,"As if electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) isn't already pulling enough levers to get investors excited about its business, it sent out invitations on Thursday for the unveiling of its long-awaited pickup truck. This news comes on the heels of Tesla swinging to a profit in Q3, obtaining a manufacturing license to start production of its made-in-China Model 3 for Chinese customers, and announcing that it's building a new vehicle factory in Berlin.

Ahead of the event, here's a look at what CEO Elon Musk has said about the truck.

CYBRTRK?

Following up on a Nov. 6 tweet from Musk noting that Tesla would unveil its new pickup truck on Nov. 21, Tesla has now sent out invitations to the truck's unveiling event. It will start at 8 p.m. PST on Thursday, Nov. 21 at the company's Design Center in Hawthorne, California. According to the invitation, the event ""will be held both indoors and outdoors.""

The invitation was sent just moments after a Twitter user discovered Tesla had filed for a trademark of the logo reading ""CYBRTRK"" -- a likely name for the truck since Musk has been referring to the vehicle as Cybertruck. Tesla has also registered the domain cybrtrk.com, as the website is currently redirecting to Tesla.com.

Design and performance

Little is known about the truck, but Musk did say in the company's third-quarter earnings call that he believes it's Tesla's ""best product ever."" Its design is expected to be bold, with Musk saying in an Oct. 13 tweet that the vehicle looks like ""an armored personnel carrier from the future.""

Tesla has also made some comments about the truck's performance in a podcast interview this spring.

It's going to be a truck that is more capable than other trucks. The goal is to be a better truck than a [ Ford ] F-150 in terms of truck-like functionality and be a better sports car than a standard [Porsche] 911. That's the aspiration.

Availability and pricing

Investors will have to wait until the event to find out when the electric-car maker expects to bring the truck to market. The company hasn't provided any specific time frame for the truck's production yet. But with Model Y production expected to be the company's current priority when it comes to new vehicles, the truck will likely come after the Model Y. Tesla's website currently forecasts Model Y production to begin in ""late 2020.""

Regarding pricing, Musk has said that the goal is for the vehicle's pricing to start at $49,000 or less.

Of course, any of these details may have changed by now. Further, the vehicle could evolve even more by the time it goes into production. Nevertheless, investors will finally get at least some answers about the highly anticipated truck during Tesla's unveiling event next week."
286,0.985,0.107,0.866,0.027,"In a reversal of a previous decision not to recommend Tesla 's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 and Model S to buyers, Consumer Reports (CR) is now saying the two models have regained a recommendation from the magazine. CR cited ""improved reliability"" based on responses to an annual survey of vehicle owners.

News of improved reliability comes at a good time for Tesla. The electric-car company is aiming to deliver a record 104,500 vehicles or more this quarter. A recommendation from CR could help boost demand for the company's Model 3 and Model S during the period.

Yet another reason to buy a Tesla vehicle

Though CR is only just now rerecommending Model 3 and Model S, there were already good reasons for customers to pull the trigger on a Tesla vehicle. Indeed, Model 3 and Model S score well on CR 's own road tests. In addition, CR said earlier this year that Tesla's customers are more satisfied than customers of any other auto brand.

Further, Tesla's vehicles are already considered to be among the safest cars in the U.S. All three of Tesla's vehicles -- Model 3, Model S, and Model X -- not only have five-star overall ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), but also have five-star ratings in every NHTSA subcategory.

Of course, the Model 3 and Model S recommendations from CR based on improved reliability is still an important endorsement, particularly as it relates to the company's Model 3. The recommendation signals the vehicle's graduation from a product of an aggressive production ramp up as part of a new vehicle program to a mature and more refined vehicle.

""The Tesla Model 3 struggled last year as the company made frequent design changes and ramped up production to meet demand,"" said CR 's director of auto testing Jake Fisher in a blog post about the magazine's decision to recommend the two models. ""But as the production stabilized, we have seen improvements to the reliability.""

Tesla is shooting for a record quarter

CR 's recommendation comes just ahead of the holidays, as Tesla is trying to ramp up production and deliveries to finish the year with record sales.

The Model 3, as Tesla's most affordable vehicle, accounts for the bulk of the electric-car maker 's sales. It represented 82% of deliveries in Q3. Combined Model S and X sales represent the remaining deliveries, with Model S deliveries likely accounting for around half of them.

While demand for Tesla's vehicles seemed to already be tracking just fine in order for the automaker to deliver record vehicles during Q4, a recommendation from CR certainly won't hurt."
287,0.9959,0.165,0.831,0.004,"As usual, earnings season brought with it its fair share of surprises and volatility. But three stories, in particular, are worth a closer look. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) have all seen their stocks soar this season as their quarterly performances surpassed expectations.

Here's a look at these companies' latest results -- and why investors have been bullish on their stocks.

Tesla

Shares of electric-car company Tesla have skyrocketed in the weeks since the company's third-quarter earnings report. The stock has risen more than 38% since the quarterly update was posted on Oct. 23, helped by a 29% gain in the two days following the release.

Investors were impressed with the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $1.86. This was much better than analysts' average forecast for a loss per share of $0.42.

With management once again reiterating in the quarterly update that its business has scaled to the point of being self-funding, the market's confidence in the company's growth story is improving.

Apple

Tech company Apple not only beat analyst expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, but also provided better-than-expected guidance for its important holiday period.

The strong results were helped by an acceleration in the growth rates of the company's two fastest-growing segments: services, and wearables, home, and accessories. Revenue in these two segments jumped 18% and 54%, respectively, year over year.

Highlighting management's optimism for its business, the midpoint of Apple's revenue guidance range for its first quarter of fiscal 2020 implied 4% revenue growth. This would mark an acceleration from 2% growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.

Apple stock is up more than 8% since its earnings report late last month.

Walt Disney

Shares of Disney also popped following the company's earnings report earlier this month. The market was impressed with the company's better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. On average, analysts had forecast earnings per share of $0.95 for the period.

But the stock got another boost more recently when Disney announced that its new streaming service, Disney+, garnered over 10 million subscribers by Nov. 13 -- one day after its launch. The new service's momentum bodes well for Disney's ongoing efforts to beef up its direct-to-consumer positioning and become less reliant on traditional television.

Shares of Disney are up more than 10% since the company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Nov. 7."
288,0.9947,0.11,0.864,0.026,"Tesla ’s (TSLA - Free Report) electric revolution continues. The pioneer in the electric vehicle (EV) space has garnered reputation as the gold standard. In less than three weeks of commencement of trial production at the Shanghai Gigafactory, it has announced the location of its second factory outside the United States.

During the third quarter, Tesla stated that it would announce the location of its European Gigafactory before the end of this year and the company’s CEO Elon Musk kept the promise. He announced his decision to build the company’s first European factory at Berlin during the German car awards ceremony on Tuesday. Musk also made a more official announcement by tweeting “GIGA BERLIN.” The plant would build batteries, power trains and vehicles, starting with the Model Y sports utility vehicle.Car production in the Berlin Gigafactory is expected to begin in late 2021.

While the United Kingdom was Tesla’s original choice for the factory, uncertainty over the nation's exit from the European Union made matters risky.

Germany seems to be a logical choice for Tesla’s European Gigafactory as the country is the biggest market for EVs with huge potential. As we know, Germany is the automotive hub with engineering prowess, and is home to various auto biggies like Volkswagen (VWAGY - Free Report) , Daimler AG (DDAIF - Free Report) and BMW (BAMXF - Free Report) . Reportedly, German carmakers and suppliers are likely to build around 150 EVs by 2023.

Per Bloomberg, Germany is far ahead of the rest of the European nations in terms of electric vehicle registrations in the first nine months of 2019. The country is increasing incentives for buying EVs to further promote adoption. It recently increased subsidies for the buyers of EVs from 4000 to 6000 euros, which will run through 2025. Further, constructing a factory in Europe would help Tesla avoid the complexities of exporting its cars to the nation, and avoid uncertainty around trade and tariffs.

Having said that, making a foray into the land of biggest carmakers and treading on some of the legacy automakers’ toes might be viewed upon as quite a bold move. But the question is can Tesla maintain its lead in the EV market once Volkswagen and other big automakers step up their game. Reportedly, some European EV models like Renault Zoe and BMW i3 have had more new registrations in Germany than Tesla models in the first nine months of 2019.

Especially, Volkswagen has been making the most aggressive investment plans in the EV space, with a planned investment of $33 billion to electrify its entire product lineup by 2023. The companyhas just begun producing the new ID.3 electric car series and announced a deal with Sweden's Northvolt to develop a battery factory in Germany. One of its popular luxury brands, Audi, is already building electric SUVs, which are set to give Tesla tough competition. Competition with deep-pocketed German challengers on their home turf will definitely be an interesting watch.

Last Words

Markedly, Berlin Gigafactory will be Tesla’s fourth Gigafactory after Nevada, New York and Shanghai. Tesla's new Shanghai plant will give the company direct access to this market and allow it to cut costs substantially. With the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company set to begin producing vehicles in China and then Europe, it is on track to achieve global automotive domination.

289,0.9944,0.118,0.828,0.054,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bears have reason to worry: The green-car maker was able to post a surprise profit during its just-reported third quarter. It's also showing interest in diversifying its business in a more focused way.

Late last month, Tesla rolled out the third version of its solar roof tiles , a result of its $2.6 billion acquisition of SolarCity in 2016 . Meanwhile, on its third-quarter earnings conference call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company's energy business will eventually be as big as or bigger than its electric-vehicle operations. Musk said the energy business was put on the back burner for the past two years as Tesla worked out problems with the Model 3. With those in the rearview mirror, the executive said Tesla can now focus on its energy business.

Tesla's been there before with little success with solar roof tiles

The new solar roof tile is a big test for Tesla in the residential solar energy market. It has long tried to justify the acquisition of SolarCity and is hanging its hat partly on solar roof tiles to meet that end. The older versions failed to take off, but Tesla is using fewer parts and different materials this time around.

Tesla's goal is to eventually install these titles on 1,000 roofs each week. That won't happen in the beginning because specially trained installers will be required, but in the future, any contractor will be able to place them on rooftops. It's not the first time Musk has set that goal. In a tweet this summer, he laid out that same time table.

Tesla has been trying to perfect these solar roof tiles for about three years, with the first two versions failing to take off. ""Version 1 and 2 [is] where we're still sort of figuring things out. Version 3, I think, is finally ready for the big time,"" said Musk during Tesla's third-quarter earnings conference call. Whether that is true remains to be seen. After all the other iterations of the solar roof tiles have failed to take off with the masses. At the same time that its residential energy business has failed to take off, its powerwall installation business has been growing.

Tesla's electric-car business humming along for now

Bears have more to worry about than Tesla's energy aspirations, even if nothing comes of earmarking billions of dollars to a business line that may not prove successful. There's also a lot of good news coming out of the electric-car business it pioneered. For the third quarter, Tesla reported a surprise profit and provided an upbeat outlook about the remainder of the year. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.86 a share, blowing past Wall Street's expectations of a loss of $0.42 a share. Revenue of $6.3 billion was in line with views.

Most of Tesla's sales came from its lower-priced Model 3 sedans. Nevertheless, gross margins increased by nearly 23% thanks to a decline in operating expenses. Tesla sold 97,000 electric vehicles during the quarter. It's Smart Summons feature, which lets Tesla owners call their cars to them from parking spaces, has been a huge hit since it launched during the third quarter. Tesla said it's already been used more than a million times.

Tesla also revealed its Gigafactory Shanghai is ready for production, taking only 10 months to build. Tesla said it was 65% less expensive to build than its manufacturing production facility for the Model 3 in the U.S. ""Gigafactory Shanghai will become a template for future growth,"" Musk said on the call. ""We're planning to build model-wise in Shanghai as well of course, and build a Gigafactory in Europe."" Musk said Tesla will announce the location for the European Gigafactory before 2019 is over.

To add even more potentially positive news to the mix, Tesla also said it's Model Y crossover is ahead of schedule, with a launch expected in the summer of 2020. Musk thinks the Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined. On top of all that, Tesla plans to roll out a limited number of its Tesla Semi trucks in 2020.

Lots of ""ifs"" Tesla has to overcome

With Musk setting Tesla's future course and with the company having a strong third quarter, it's not surprising investors are rewarding the green-car maker. Since Tesla reported earnings in late October, the stock has been climbing, with shares up around 30%. The day after Tesla released its earnings report, its shares gained more than 16%.

Shorts could be on tap for more losses if Tesla is able to deliver on its vision of the future. There are a lot of ""ifs"" for a company that has a track record for disappointing and a CEO who has been known to make claims that never come to fruition. In order for the stock to continue its upward trajectory, Tesla will need to launch the Model Y with nothing in the way of production snafus -- and consumers are going to want to have it as much as the Model 3. At the same time, Tesla has to keep electric-truck competition at bay, continue to add innovation to its software, and grow its energy business. That's a tall order, but one that could reward bulls if Tesla is successful."
